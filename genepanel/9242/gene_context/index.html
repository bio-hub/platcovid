Finally, expanded umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells or (UC-MSCs) may have a role and are being studied. […] Thus, at this point, the avoidance of the cytokine storm may be the key for the treatment of HCOV-19 infected patients.In China, where there was limited availability of effective modalities to manage COVID-19 several patients were treated with expanded UC-MSCs. […] The limited but emerging evidence regarding UC MSC in managing COVID-19 suggests that it might be considered for compassionate use in critically ill patients to reduce morbidity and mortality in the United States. […] The administration and Coronavirus Task Force might wish to approach the potential of expanded UC-MSCs as an evolutionary therapeutic strategy in managing COVID-19 illness with a 3-pronged approach: If proven safe and effective on a specific and limited basis…1.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. […] This study aims to investigate whether MSC transplantation improves the outcome of 7 enrolled patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in Beijing YouAn Hospital, China, from Jan 23, 2020 to Feb 16, 2020. […] The clinical outcomes, as well as changes of inflammatory and immune function levels and adverse effects of 7 enrolled patients were assessed for 14 days after MSC injection. […] MSCs could cure or significantly improve the functional outcomes of seven patients without observed adverse effects. […] The pulmonary function and symptoms of these seven patients were significantly improved in 2 days after MSC transplantation. […] Meanwhile, the level of TNF-α was significantly decreased, while IL-10 increased in MSC treatment group compared to the placebo control group. […] Furthermore, the gene expression profile showed MSCs were ACE2<sup>-</sup> and TMPRSS2<sup>-</sup> which indicated MSCs are free from COVID-19 infection. […] Thus, the intravenous transplantation of MSCs was safe and effective for treatment in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, especially for the patients in critically severe condition.

A new study published by the journal Aging &amp; Disease reported that intravenous administration of clinical-grade human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in improved functional outcomes (<i>Leng et al., Aging Dis, 11:216-228, 2020</i>). […] This study demonstrated that intravenous infusion of MSCs is a safe and effective approach for treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, including elderly patients displaying severe pneumonia. […] Therefore, MSC therapy inhibiting the overactivation of the immune system and promoting endogenous repair by improving the lung microenvironment after the SARS-CoV-2 infection found in this study is striking.

Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (MSCs), have demonstrated safety and possible efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although not as yet well studied in respiratory virus-induced ARDS. […] Limited pre-clinical data suggest that systemic MSC administration can significantly reduce respiratory virus (Influenza strains H5N1 and H9N2)-induced lung injury, however, there are no available data in models of coronavirus respiratory infection.There are a rapidly increasing number of clinical investigations of cell-based therapy approaches for COVID-19. […] To provide a rationale strategy to maximise potential therapeutic use, it is critically important to understand the relevant pre-clinical studies and postulated mechanisms of MSC actions in respiratory virus-induced lung injuries.

In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. […] Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. […] After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. […] In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient’s immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment. […] However, currently, there are no approved MSC-based approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients but clinical trials ongoing.

Transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is a promising choice for treating virus-induced pneumonia, and was needed to treat H7N9 induced ARDS at the time. […] MSCs transplant into patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were conducted in a single center and open-label clinical trial. […] Based on the principle of voluntariness and informed consent, 44 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were included as a control group while 17 patients with H7N9 induced ARDS were served as an experimental group with allogeneic menstrual blood-derived MSC. […] Notably, MSC transplantation significantly lower the mortality compared with in control group (17.6% died in MSC group vs 54.5% died in control group). […] Furthermore, MSC transplantation did not result in harmful effects in human body within the 5 year follow up period with 4 patients. […] Collectively, these results suggest that MSCs significantly improve survival rate of H7N9 induced ARDS and provide a theoretical basis for the treatment of H7N9 induced ARDS in both preclinical research and clinical studies. […] Because H7N9 and the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) share similar complications (such as ARDS and lung failure) and corresponding multi-organ dysfunction, MSC-based therapy could be a possible alternative for treating COVID-19.

We have previous evidence in murine models that MSc’s secretome can be used to treat pulmonary injuries induced with bleomycin, due to its content: growth factors, extracellular vesicles, and exosomes.

Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) possess potent and broad-ranging immunomodulatory activities. […] Multiple in vivo studies in animal models and ex vivo human lung models have demonstrated the MSC’s impressive capacity to inhibit lung damage, reduce inflammation, dampen immune responses and aid with alveolar fluid clearance. […] Additionally, MSCs produce molecules that are antimicrobial and reduce pain. […] The in vivo safety of local and intravenous administration of MSCs has been demonstrated in multiple human clinical trials, including studies of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). […] Recently, the application of MSCs in the context of ongoing COVID-19 disease and other viral respiratory illnesses has demonstrated reduced patient mortality and, in some cases, improved long-term pulmonary function. […] Adipose-derived stem cells (ASC), an abundant type of MSC, are proposed as a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19 in order to reduce morbidity and mortality.

We focus this editorial specifically on the background to, and the rationale for, the use and evaluation of mesenchymal stromal (Stem) cells (MSCs) in treatment trials of patients with severe COVID-19 disease. […] MSCs should also be trialed for treatment of severe cases of MERS where mortality rates are upto 34% and MERS-CoV remains a WHO priority Blueprint pathogen. […] It’s about time funding agencies now invest more into development MSCs per se and other host-directed therapies in combination with other therapeutic interventions. […] MSC therapy could turn out to be an important contribution to bringing an end to the high COVID-19 and MERS death rates.

Cell therapy with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is a potential treatment for COVID-19 ARDS based on preclinical and clinical studies supporting the concept that MSCs modulate the inflammatory and remodeling processes and restore alveolo-capillary barriers. […] The authors performed a systematic literature review and random-effects meta-analysis to determine the potential value of MSC therapy for treating COVID-19-infected patients with ARDS. […] MSCs were intravenously or intratracheally administered in 200 participants, who were followed for 14 days to 5 years. […] All MSCs were allogeneic from bone marrow, umbilical cord, menstrual blood, adipose tissue, or unreported sources. […] No comparisons were made between MSCs of different sources.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy may be an potential alternative strategy for treating ARDS by targeting the various pathophysiological events of ARDS. […] By releasing a variety of paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles, MSC can exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-microbial, and pro-angiogenic effects, promote bacterial and alveolar fluid clearance, disrupt the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cell damage, eventually avoiding the lung and distal organ injuries to rescue patients with ARDS. […] An increasing number of experimental animal studies and early clinical studies verify the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy in ARDS. […] Since low cell engraftment and survival in lung limit MSC therapeutic potentials, several strategies have been developed to enhance their engraftment in the lung and their intrinsic, therapeutic properties. […] Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and optimization of MSC therapy in ARDS and highlighted the potentials and possible barriers of MSC therapy for COVID-19 patients with ARDS.

The broad immunomodulatory properties of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has allowed for wide application in regenerative medicine as well as immune/inflammatory diseases, including unmatched allogeneic use.

[…] Interestingly, MSCT preclinical data specifically on immune/inflammatory disorders of the lungs were among the earliest to be reported in 2003, with the first clinical use of MSCT for graft-vs-host disease reported in 2004. […] Since these first reports, preclinical data showing beneficial effects of MSC immunomodulation have accumulated substantially, and as a consequence, over a third of MSCT clinical trials now target immune/inflammatory diseases. […] There is much preclinical evidence for MSCT in noninfectious-including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-as well as infectious bacterial immune/inflammatory lung disorders, with data generally demonstrating therapeutic effects; however, for infectious viral pulmonary conditions, the preclinical evidence is more scarce with some inconsistent outcomes. […] In this article, we review the mechanistic evidence for clinical use of MSCs in pulmonary immune/inflammatory disorders, and survey the ongoing clinical trials-including for COVID-19-of MSCT for these diseases, with some perspectives and comment on MSCT for COVID-19.

[…] It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells’ hemocompatibility and safety profile. […] Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism.

The mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), known to remodel in disease and have an extensive secretome, has recently been isolated from the human heart. […] However, the effects of normal and diseased cardiac MSCs on myocyte electrophysiology remain unclear. […] We hypothesize that in disease the inflammatory secretome of cardiac human MSCs (hMSCs) remodels and can regulate arrhythmia substrates. hMSCs were isolated from patients with or without heart failure from tissue attached to extracted device leads and from samples taken from explanted/donor hearts. […] Failing hMSCs or nonfailing hMSCs were cocultured with normal human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. […] Failing and nonfailing hMSCs from both sources exhibited similar trilineage differentiation potential and cell surface marker expression as bone marrow hMSCs. […] Compared with nonfailing hMSCs, failing hMSCs prolonged action potential duration by 24% (P&lt;0.001, n=15), increased Ca2+ alternans by 300% (P&lt;0.001, n=18), and promoted spontaneous calcium release activity (n=14, P&lt;0.013) in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. […] Failing hMSCs exhibited increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL (interleukin)-1β (98%, P&lt;0.0001) and IL-6 (460%, P&lt;0.02) compared with nonfailing hMSCs. […] IL-1β or IL-6 in the absence of hMSCs prolonged action potential duration but only IL-6 increased Ca2+ alternans and promoted spontaneous calcium release activity in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, replicating the effects of failing hMSCs. […] In contrast, nonfailing hMSCs prevented Ca2+ alternans in human cardiac myocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells during oxidative stress. […] Finally, nonfailing hMSCs exhibited &gt;25× higher secretion of IGF (insulin-like growth factor)-1 compared with failing hMSCs. […] Importantly, IGF-1 supplementation or anti-IL-6 treatment rescued the arrhythmia substrates induced by failing hMSCs. […] We identified device leads as a novel source of cardiac hMSCs.

[…] Here in this review, we will discuss the major challenges of MSC therapies in clinical application, the factors impacting the diversity of MSCs, the potential approaches that modify MSC products with the highest therapeutic potential, and finally the usage of MSCs for COVID-19 pandemic disease.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), multipotent stromal cells that mediate immunomodulation and regeneration, could be of potential benefit to a subset of COVID-19 subjects with acute respiratory failure. […] In this review, we discuss key features of the current COVID-19 outbreak, and the rationale for MSC-based therapy in this setting, as well as the limitations associated with this therapeutic approach.

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), owing to their powerful immunomodulatory abilities, have the potential to attenuate the cytokine storm and have therefore been proposed as a potential therapeutic approach for which several clinical trials are underway. […] Given that intravenous infusion of MSCs results in a significant trapping in the lung, MSC therapy could directly mitigate inflammation, protect alveolar epithelial cells, and reverse lung dysfunction by normalizing the pulmonary microenvironment and preventing pulmonary fibrosis. […] In this review, we present an overview and perspectives of the SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory dysfunction and the potential of MSC immunomodulation for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 related pulmonary disease.
