Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. […] There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients’ NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. […] Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.

Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Coranavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently based on real-time PCR (RT-PCR) performed on either nasopharyngeal (NPS) or oropharyngeal (OPS) swabs; saliva specimen collection can be used, too. […] The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner. […] We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx.

Archived nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens of 58 COVID-19 patients were tested with the Xpert<sup>®</sup> Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay. […] SARS-CoV-2 was detected in either NPS or saliva specimens of all patients. […] Among them, 84.5% (49/58) tested positive in both NPS and saliva, 10.3% (6/58) tested positive in NPS only, and 5.2% (3/58) tested positive in saliva only. […] No significant difference in detection rate was observed between NPS and saliva (McNemar’s test <i>p</i>=0.5078). […] The detection rate was slightly higher for N2 (NPS 94.8% and Saliva 93.1%) than that of the E gene target (Saliva:89.7% vs 82.8%) on both specimen types. […] Significant earlier median Ct value was observed for NPS comparing to that of saliva on both E (26.8 vs 29.7, <i>p</i>=0.0002) and N2 gene target (29.3 vs 32.3, <i>p</i>=0.0002). […] The median Ct value of E gene target was significantly earlier than that of the N2 gene target for both NPS (26.8 vs 29.3, <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001) and saliva (29.7 vs 32.3, <i>p</i>&lt;0.0001). […] In conclusion, posterior oropharyngeal saliva and NPS were found to have similar detection rates in the point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

[…] The median duration of viral shedding from sputum specimens (34 days, IQR 24-40 days) was significantly longer than from NPS (19 days, IQR 14-25 days; P&lt;0.001). […] It was noteworthy that in 9 patients the viral RNA was detected in sputum after NPS turned negative. […] Chronic lung disease and steroids were associated with virus detection in sputum, and diabetes mellitus was associated with virus detection in both NPS and sputum.

The first prospective study consisted of 75 patients with COVID-19 who were ready for discharge and who had 2 consecutive negative results per nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of viral samples retrieved with nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs). […] Because of detection of potential false negatives in that cohort, the NAAT results of paired OS and NPS samples from 50 additional recruits with COVID-19 during their recovery stage were used in a second prospective study to compare the diagnostic values of the 2 viral RNA sampling methods. […] For parallel NAAT of OS and NPS samples in the second study, McNemar’s test indicated that the difference between the frequencies of inconsistent parts of OS and NPS was statistically significant (P = 0.021). […] Cohen’s kappa coefficient for OS and NPS was 0.244, which is indicative of fair consistency. […] The NPS test has a risk of sending home more patients (59%) who still have the infection, while the OS test will make such an error in fewer patients (14%).

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are widely accepted as specimens for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. […] However, the collection procedures for NPS specimens causes sneezing and coughing in most patients, which generate droplets or aerosol particles that are hazardous to the healthcare workers collecting these specimens. […] In this study, 95 patient-matched paired deep throat saliva (DTS) and NPS specimens from 62 patients were analyzed. […] The rates of detection for DTS (53.7%) and NPS (47.4%) samples were comparable (P = .13). […] In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR was equivalent in DTS and NPS specimens.

Objective: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 by oropharyngeal swabs (OPS) and nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) is an essential method for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) management. […] Methods: In this prospective study, 120 paired NPS and OPS specimens were collected from 120 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19. […] The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load were analyzed with regards NPS and OPS. […] Results: The SARS-CoV-2 detection rate was significantly higher for NPS [46.7% (56/120)] than OPS [10.0% (12/120)] (P &lt; 0.001). […] The sensitivity of NPS was also significantly higher than that of OPS (P &lt; 0.001). […] 20.5 days, respectively) and a longer maximum duration (41 vs. 39 days, respectively) in NPS than OPS. […] The mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of NPS (37.8, 95% CI: 37.0-38.6) was significantly lower than that of OPS (39.4, 95% CI: 38.9-39.8) by 1.6 (95% CI 1.0-2.2, P &lt; 0.001), indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 load was significantly higher in NPS specimens than OPS. […] During NPS sampling, patients were significantly less likely to have nausea and vomit. […] Conclusions: NPS had significantly higher SARS-CoV-2 detection rate, sensitivity, and viral load than OPS. […] NPS could reduce droplets production during swabs. […] NPS should be recommended for diagnosing COVID-19 and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 load.

Encapsulation of antiviral agents into nanoparticles (NPs) has been shown to improve bioavailability, control release, and reduce side effects. […] However, there is little quantitative understanding of how the uptake of NPs into virally infected cells compares to uninfected cells. […] In this work, the uptake of fluorescently labeled polymer NPs was investigated in several models of rhinovirus (RV) infected cells. […] Different multiplicities of RV infections (MOI) and timings of NPs uptake were also investigated. […] In some cases, RV infection resulted in a significant increase of NPs uptake, but this was not universally noted. […] For HeLa cells, RV-A16 and RV-A01 infection elevated NPs uptake upon increasing the incubation time, whereas at later timepoints (6 h) a reduced uptake was noted with RV-A01 infection (owing to decreased cell viability). […] Beas-2B cells exhibited more complex trends: decreases in NPs uptake (cf. uninfected cells) were observed at short incubation times following RV-A01 and RV-A16 infection. […] At later incubation times (4 h), we found a marked decrease of NPs uptake for RV-A01 infected cells but an increase in uptake with RV-A16 infected cells. […] Where increases in NPs uptake were found, they were very modest compared to results previously reported for a hepatitis C/ Huh7.5 cell line model. […] An increase in RV dose (MOI) was not associated with any notable change of NPs uptake. […] These findings suggest that NPs entry into virally infected cells is a complex process, and further work is required to unravel the different factors which govern this.

Nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) are the currently accepted standard for sample collection but are limited by their need for collection devices and sampling by trained healthcare professionals. […] The aim of this study was to compare the performance of saliva to NPS in an outpatient setting. […] This was a prospective study conducted at three centers, which compared the performance of saliva and NPS samples collected at the time of assessment center visit. […] Samples were tested by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sensitivity and overall agreement determined between saliva and NPS. […] Of the 432 paired samples, 46 were positive for SARS-CoV-2, with seven discordant observed between the two sample types (four individuals testing positive only by NPS and three by saliva only). […] The observed agreement was 98.4% (kappa coefficient 0.91) and a composite reference standard demonstrated sensitivity of 0.91 and 0.93 for saliva and NPS samples, respectively. […] On average, the Ct values obtained from saliva as compared to NPS were higher by 2.76. […] This study demonstrates that saliva performs comparably to NPS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. […] The use of saliva as an acceptable alternative to NPS could support the use of widespread surveillance testing for SARS-CoV-2.

Saliva is non-invasive specimen suitable for mass-screening, but data comparing utility of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and saliva in RT-LAMP test are lacking and it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected by direct processing of samples without the need for prior RNA extraction saliva. […] In this study, we compared utility of saliva and NPS samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a novel RT-fluorescence LAMP (RT-fLAMP). […] The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-fLAMP with RNA extraction were 97% and 100%, respectively, with equivalent utility of NPS and saliva. […] However, sensitivity was decreased to 71% and 47% in NPS and saliva samples without RNA extraction, respectively, suggesting that RNA extraction process may be critical for the virus detection by RT-fLAMP.

The simple and painless process of saliva collection allows for widespread testing, but enthusiasm is hampered by variable performance compared to that of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. […] We prospectively collected paired NPS and saliva samples from a total of 300 unique adult and pediatric patients. […] Performance of saliva and NPS was compared against the total number of positives regardless of specimen type. […] The overall concordances for saliva and NPS were 91.0% (273/300) and 94.7% (284/300), respectively. […] The values for positive percent agreement (PPA) for saliva and NPS were 81.4% (79/97) and 89.7% (87/97), respectively. […] Saliva yielded detection of 10 positive cases that were negative by NPS. […] For symptomatic and asymptomatic pediatric patients not previously diagnosed with COVID-19, the performances of saliva and NPS were comparable (PPA, 82.4% versus 85.3%). […] The overall values for PPA for adults were 83.3% and 90.7% for saliva and NPS, respectively, with saliva yielding detection of 4 fewer cases than NPS. […] However, saliva performance for symptomatic adults was identical to NPS performance (PPA of 93.8%). […] With lower cost and self-collection capabilities, saliva can be an appropriate sample choice alternative to NPS for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in children and adults.
