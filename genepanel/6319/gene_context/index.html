This study aims to investigate, retrospectively, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, laboratory results, radiologic findings, and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with transfusion-dependent β thalassemia major (TM), β-thalassemia intermedia (TI) and sickle cell disease (SCD). […] A total of 13 patients, 7 with TM, 3 with TI, and 3 with SCD, with confirmed COVID-19, were identified in 6 Centers from different countries. […] Increased C-reactive protein (6/10), high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 6/10), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 6/10) were the most common laboratory findings. 6/10 patients had an exacerbation of anemia (2 with SCD). […] In one Center (Oman), the majority of suspected cases were observed in patients with SCD between the age of 21 and 40 years. […] A rapid clinical improvement of tachypnea/dyspnea and oxygen saturation was observed, after red blood cell exchange transfusion, in a young girl with SCD and worsening of anemia (Hb level from 9.2 g/dl to 6.1g/dl).

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). […] Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. […] Six COVID-19 patients (4 on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/mL and were not treated with SCD. […] The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy respectively. […] The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging. […] A multicenter clinical trial is underway with a FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption to evaluate the potential of SCD therapy to effectively treat COVID-19 ICU patients.

The management of sickle cell disease (SCD) and its complications in the COVID-19 era is very challenging. […] The recurrent sickling process in SCD causes tissue hypoxemia and micro-infarcts, resulting in end organ damage. […] Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, little data has been published about SCD concerning clinical presentation with COVID-19 and management. […] Hydroxyurea has been the cornerstone of management in children and adults with SCD, with evidence of its effect on controlling end organ damage. […] There are several anti-sickling drugs that have been approved recently that might have an additive value toward the management of SCD and its complications. […] Prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered in every management protocol because SCD and COVID-19 are thrombogenic conditions. […] Management proposals of different presentations of patients with SCD and COVID-19 are outlined.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly identified strain of the coronavirus family that has been shown to affect the hemoglobin beta chain, the same chain that has sickle cell disease (SCD) mutation. […] This study was undertaken to see if COVID-19 infection increased disease severity in patients with SCD. […] A total of 38,092 Bahraini people were tested for COVID-19 during this period; 378 (1%) were SCD patients. […] Six patients with SCD had COVID-19 (1.6%): three remained asymptomatic, two had mild symptoms and one required oxygen therapy. […] The SCD patients had a similar average length of stay when compared with non-SCD COVID-19 patients (10.7 days). […] The infection rate, clinical course and viral clearance seen for the SCD patients with COVID-19 were no different to those without SCD.

We report the emergency use of immunomodulatory therapy utilizing an extracorporeal selective cytopheretic device (SCD) in two patients with elevated serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels and refractory COVID-19 ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). […] Once identified, emergency/expanded use permission for SCD treatment was obtained and patient consented. […] Six COVID-19 patients (four on ECMO) with severe ARDS were also screened with IL-6 levels less than 100 pg/ml and were not treated with SCD. […] The two patients were successfully weaned off ECMO after 17 and 16 days of SCD therapy, respectively. […] The results observed with SCD therapy on these two critically ill COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS and elevated IL-6 is encouraging. […] A multicenter clinical trial is underway with an FDA-approved investigational device exemption to evaluate the potential of SCD therapy to effectively treat COVID-19 intensive care unit patients.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) patients are commonly affected by pulmonary complications such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), pulmonary embolism (PE) and pneumonia that contribute to significant mortality risks.

However, there have been case reports of sudden cardiac death (SCD) with the wearing of facemasks during exercise. […] In this paper, we hypothesize that exercise with facemasks may increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) leading to SCD via the development of acute and/or intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia.

There were 623 pediatric and adult patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or beta thalassemia (BT) and COVID-19. […] So, our analysis focused on children and adolescents with SCD: there were 121 pediatric patients, one adolescent died, prophylactic anticoagulation was prescribed to six patients, 11.76% needed intensive care unit, blood transfusion was prescribed in 29.70%. […] Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) and acute chest syndrome (ACS) were the main clinical manifestations in SCD. […] Pediatric patients with SCD and COVID-19 have a low mortality rate when compared to adults, although is higher than the global pediatric population with COVID-19 (0-0.67%). […] In SCD the clinical manifestations, both in children and adults, are VOC and ACS, and there was increase in blood requirement. […] Pediatric SCD patients with COVID-19 need more intensive care unit than the global pediatric population (3.30%). […] Despite pediatric population with SCD needs more intensive care, the outcome after infection by COVID-19 is favorable.

We aimed to evaluate COVID-19 and sickle cell disease (SCD)-related experiences, and the clinical course during the outbreak, to measure anxiety levels of adolescent and young adult patients with homozygous SCD, to analyze the correlations between their COVID-19 experiences and anxiety levels and painful episodes.

During this pandemic, patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) have been placed in the “high-risk” category of the population.

The global spread of CoV2-SARS infection with a respiratory tropism, endothelial damages and procoagulant status endangers the SCD population. […] However, with only a few case reports, consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on SCD population remain poorly known. […] This case recalls the importance of an increased prevention policy against COVID-19among the SCD population. […] (3) Unexpectedly, our patient did not develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and acute cor pulmonale (ACP), whereas this is a common feature of ARDS during SCD. […] These last two observations suggest a different pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders in SCD patients in the case of SARS COv2.

We aimed to identify predictors of outcomes and survival in patients living in 4 major metropolitan areas who had sickle cell disease (SCD) and COVID-19 to inform best approaches to prevention and care. […] Data were collected at baseline and during the clinical course in SCD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in four COVID-19 epicenters. […] Of sixty-six SCD patients with COVID-19, fifty patients (75%) required hospitalization, and seven died (10.6%). […] All deaths occurred in individuals not taking hydroxyurea or any other SCD-modifying therapy. […] Patients with SCD and COVID-19 exhibited a broad range of disease severity. […] We cannot definitively state that the overall mortality is higher in patients with SCD, although our case fatality rate was ∼10% compared with ∼3% in the general population, despite a median age of 34 years. […] Individuals with SCD aged &gt;50 years, with preexisting cardiopulmonary, renal disease, and/or stroke not receiving hydroxyurea, who present with high serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and D-dimer levels, are at higher risk of death, irrespective of genotype or sex.
