The pathogen of COVID-19 is SARS-COV-2, and previous studies have proposed the relationship between ABO blood group and coronavirus.

[…] Compared to other ABO blood type, an increased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with A blood group (OR: 1.249, 95%CI: 1.114-1.440, P &lt; 0.001) and a decreased odds of infecting COVID-19 among individuals with blood group O (OR: 0.699, 95%CI: 0.635-0.770, P &lt; 0.001) were found. […] The current meta-analysis suggest that blood type A might be more susceptible to infect COVID-19 while blood type O might be less susceptible to infect COVID-19; there were no correlation between ABO blood group and severity or demise of COVID-19.

Growing evidence suggests that ABO blood group may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with group O individuals less likely to test positive and group A conferring a higher susceptibility to infection and propensity to severe disease. […] The level of evidence supporting an association between ABO type and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 ranges from small observational studies, to genome-wide-association-analyses and country-level meta-regression analyses. […] ABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharides expressed on red cells and other tissues (notably endothelium). […] There are several hypotheses to explain the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection by ABO type. […] ABO type-associated variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 activity and levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII could also influence adverse outcomes, notably in group A individuals who express high VWF levels.

Several studies indicated that the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanism related (Angiotensin converting enzymes, Transmembrane serine protease-2, Furin) and host innate immune response related genes (Interferons, Interleukins, Toll like receptors); HLA, ABO, 3p21.31 and 9q34.2 loci are critical host determinants related to Covid-19 severity.
