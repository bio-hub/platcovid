The outbreak of Covid-19 epidemics has challenged the provision of health care worldwide, highlighting the main flaws of some national health systems with respect to their capacity to cope with the needs of frail subjects. […] Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with Covid-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home.

[…] There are no clinically approved vaccines or antiviral drugs available for either of new or old corona infections; thus, the development of effective therapeutic and preventive strategies that can be readily available to cope with these strains.

Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. […] The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. […] Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. […] Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g., distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date.

The e-mental health intervention ‘CoPE It’ has been developed to offer manualised and evidence-based psychotherapeutic support adapted to COVID-19-related issues in order to overcome psychological distress. […] In our study, we aim to assess the efficacy of the e-mental health intervention ‘CoPE It’ in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms as well as improving self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). […] Furthermore, we want to evaluate the programme’s usability, feasibility and participants’ satisfaction with ‘CoPE It’ (tertiary outcome). […] The e-mental health intervention ‘CoPE It’ consists of four 30 min modules, conducted every other day, involving psychotherapeutic techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioural therapy.

In relevance to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic crisis, viral infections in general and RNA viruses in particular are known to induce and promote oxidative stress, consequently increasing the body’s demand for micronutrients, especially those related to antioxidant enzymic systems, thus draining the body of micronutrients, and so hindering the human body’s ability to cope optimally with oxidative stress. […] Common polymorphisms in major antioxidant enzymes, with world population minor allele frequencies ranging from 0·5 to 50 %, are related to altered enzymic function, with substantial potential effects on the body’s ability to cope with viral infection-induced oxidative stress. […] We delineate functional polymorphisms in several human antioxidant enzymes that require, especially during a viral crisis, adequate and potentially additional nutritional support to cope with the pathological consequences of disease.

The current study tested whether difficulty with emotion regulation was related to greater estimated blood alcohol content (eBAC) during a typical week in the past month and if this was due to COVID-related distress and drinking to cope with the pandemic. […] Difficulty with engaging in goal-directed behaviors was related to greater past-month eBAC and this relation was mediated by the sequential effects of COVID-related worry and drinking to cope with the pandemic. […] Results indicate that individuals with difficulty engaging in goal-directed behaviors are especially vulnerable to greater eBAC during the COVID-19 pandemic which may be due in part to their vulnerability to more COVID-related worry which may lead to more drinking to cope with the pandemic.
