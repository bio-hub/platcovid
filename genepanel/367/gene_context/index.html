Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses from the Coronaviridae family affecting neurological, gastrointestinal, hepatic and respiratory systems. […] Clearly, forecasting the “confirmed” and “recovered” COVID-19 cases helps planning to control the disease and plan for utilization of health care resources. […] Time series models based on statistical methodology are useful to model time-indexed data and for forecasting. […] Autoregressive time series models based on two-piece scale mixture normal distributions, called TP-SMN-AR models, is a flexible family of models involving many classical symmetric/asymmetric and light/heavy tailed autoregressive models.

Spring and Summer 2020 are unique in that the challenges of care for those suffering from pollen allergy coincide with the COVID-19 pandemic. […] Several considerations are important to allow optimal care of allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma and hence prevention of coronavirus spread through sneezing, rhinorrhoea and coughing. […] This compact overview of recommendations by the EUFOREA expert teams on allergic airway diseases and AIT is based on investigation of the current COVID-19 literature in association with the key words above and shared clinical experience of the experts involved. […] It deals with similarities and differences between AR and coronavirus infection, specific recommendations for allergic disease care in the COVID-19 era, including guidance on allergen specific immunotherapy, AIT.

Sex-differences in infectious diseases are a common but neglected problem. […] We used the national surveillance database of COVID-19 in mainland China to compared gender differences in attack rate (AR), proportion of severe and critical cases (PSCC) and case fatality rate (CFR) in relation to age, affected province, and onset-to-diagnosis interval. […] The overall AR was significantly higher in female population than in males (63.9 versus 60.5 per million persons; P ˂ .001). […] The female-to-male differences were age-dependent, which were significant among people aged 50-69 years for AR, and in the patients of 30-years or older for both PSCC and CFR (all P ≤ .001). […] The AR, PSCC and CFR varied greatly from province to province. […] However, female-to-male differences in AR, PSCC and CFR were significant in the epicenter, Hubei province, where 82.2% confirmed cases and 97.4% deaths occurred. […] After adjusting for age, affected province and onset-to-diagnosis interval, the female-to-male difference in AR, PSCC and CFR remained significant in multivariate logistic regression analyses. […] Further epidemiological and biological investigations are required to better understand the sex-specific differences for effective interventions.

In Nigeria, there were 1, 932 COVID-19 confirmed cases, 319 discharged cases and 58 deaths as of 30th April 2020. […] This paper, therefore, subjected the daily cumulative reported COVID-19 cases of these three variables to nine (9) curve estimation statistical models in simple, quadratic, cubic, and quartic forms. […] We identified the best models to be Quartic Linear Regression Model with an autocorrelated error of order 1 (AR(1)); and found the Ordinary Least Squares, Cochrane Orcutt, Hildreth-Lu, and Prais-Winsten and Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimators useful to estimate the models’ parameters. […] The forecast values are alarming, and so, the Nigerian Government needs to hastily review her activities and interventions towards COVID-19 to provide some tactical and robust structures and measures to avert these challenges.

Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC), a web-based program informed by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) constructs and featuring online videos, discussion forums, and videoconferencing was developed to target depression, anxiety, and experiences of excess stress among university students. […] Assessment of an eight-week web-based mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) program in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (primary outcomes) and increasing mindfulness (secondary outcome) within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. […] The outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, and mindfulness) were measured via online survey at baseline and at eight weeks post-intervention using the Patient Health Questionniare-9 (PHQ9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). […] Analyses employed generalized estimation equation (GEE) methods with AR(1) covariance structures and were adjusted for possible covariates (gender, age, country of birth, ethnicity, English as first language, paid work, unpaid work, relationship status, physical exercise, self-rated health, and access to private mental health counselling). […] Of the 159 students who provided T1 data, 32 were males and 125 were females with a mean age of 22.55 years. […] Participants in the MVC (n = 79) and WLC (n = 80) groups were similar in sociodemographic characteristics at T1 with the exception of gender and weekly hours of unpaid volunteer work. […] At post-intervention follow-up, per the adjusted comparisons, there were statistically significant between-group reductions in depression scores (β = -2.21, P = .01) and anxiety scores (β = -4.82, P = .006) and a significant increase in mindfulness scores (β = 4.84, P = .02) compared to WLC. […] There were no statistically significant differences in perceived stress for MVC (β = .64, P = .48) compared to WLC. […] Online mindfulness interventions can be effective in addressing common mental health conditions among post-secondary populations on a large scale, simultaneously reducing the current burden on traditional counselling services. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN12249616" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN12249616</a>.

COVID 19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a newly discovered coronavirus, has caused the global pandemic of early 2020. […] The first case was described in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and by March 2020, most countries around the world have put in place some of the strictest restrictions seen in decades in order to slow down the spread of the disease. […] Patients with pre-existing hypertension and cardiovascular comorbidities were reported to be at an increased risk of serious infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. […] Considering that those are among the most common chronic medical conditions in the Western world, the potential impact of it is huge. […] Furthermore, the association between ACE inhibitors/AR blockers, which are among the most frequently prescribed medications, and serious cases of COVID 19 has been studied with the same mechanism in mind. […] The reports on the association between hypertension and COVID 19 morbidity and mortality are less clear, and the International Society of Hypertension even claims that there is none. […] The reports on the association between heart failure or coronary disease and COVID 19 are more uniform, and all seem to point to a greater risk from serious infections faced by patients with those comorbidities. […] A significant effort will need to be invested by the scientific community into finding strategies for protecting those patients from contracting the virus in the first place and then, once infected, into developing management plans aimed at preserving cardiac function as much as possible.

A new coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in Wuhan city, China, in December 2019 causing atypical pneumonia and affecting multiple body organs. […] The rapidly increasing numbers of infected patients and deaths due to COVID-19 disease necessitated declaring it as a global pandemic. […] Drug repurposing approach has been pursued as a temporary management tactic to treat COVID-19 patients. […] Delving into the possible mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between COVID-19 and PCa alludes a potential association between SARS-CoV-2 targets on host epithelial cells and PCa genetic aberrations and molecular signatures, including AR and TMPRSS2.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has recently brought to attention the myriad of neuro- logic sequelae associated with Coronavirus infection including the predilection for stroke, particularly in young patients. […] Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a well-described clinical syndrome leading to vasoconstriction in the intracra- nial vessels, and has been associated with convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage and oc- casionally cervical artery dissection. […] It is usually reported in the context of a trigger such as medications, recreational drugs, or the postpartum state; however, it has not been described in COVID-19 infection. […] We report a case of both cervical vertebral ar- tery dissection as well as convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage due to RCVS, in a pa- tient with COVID-19 infection and no other triggers.

Management of novel viral respiratory disease outbreak on-board a ship with person-to-person transmission can be a public health challenge because of close proximity of inhabitants due to confined space and air-conditioned environment. […] It has a potential to be explosive, with high secondary attack rate (SAR) and cause significant morbidity and mortality. […] This study compares control measures instituted on-board two ships with similar outbreaks and recommends a standardized evidence-based outbreak response against them. […] This is a descriptive study, showing comparative analysis of control measures instituted on-board two ships, a cruise ship in case of COVID-19 and a warship in case of H1N1 influenza, with novel viral respiratory disease outbreak, at different span of time. […] Data of the date of onset, clinical details, laboratory results, history of travel, history of contact with positive case and control measures initiated were collected, analysed and compared. […] Of the two ships compared, one was a cruise ship with 712 COVID-19 cases, with an attack rate (AR) of 19.2% and 13 deaths, and other a warship with 14 cases of H1N1 influenza and an AR of 4.83%. […] Active surveillance, early self-reporting and immediate disembarkation of the suspects, along with strict compliance of hand hygiene, cough etiquettes and disinfection enhancement, will help in early mitigation of the outbreak.

[…] The ARs in affected counties ranged from 0.6 to 9750.4 per million persons, with a median of 8.8. […] The higher AR of COVID-19 was significantly associated with lower average temperature, moderate cumulative precipitation and higher wind speed. […] Warm areas can also be in higher risk of the disease with the increasing wind speed.

Astragali Radix (AR) and Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR) are widely used as traditional tonic and promising edible immunomodulatory herbal medicine, but the systemic mechanism is not well understood. […] Therefore, a strategy based on network pharmacology and molecular docking was designed to explore the systemic mechanism of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia. […] After a series of bioinformatics assays, seven kernel targets were obtained, including TNF, IL6, IFNG, IL1B, IL10, IL4, and TLR9. […] And seven key compounds were identified as the synergy components of AR-AMR acting on pneumonia, the four key compounds belonging to AR were (3R)-3-(2-hydroxy-3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-chromanol, formononetin, quercetin, and kaempferol, the three key compounds belonging to AMR were atractylone, 14-acetyl-12-senecioyl-2E, 8E, 10E-atractylentriol, and α-Amyrin. […] Collectively, these observations strongly suggest that the molecular mechanisms of AR-AMR regulating pneumonia were closely related to the correlation between inflammation and immune response. […] PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Astragali radix and Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma can be used as “medicine-food homology” for dietary supplement.

[…] Focusing on the existing S protein structure, molecular docking was used in this study to calculate the binding energy and interaction sites between 14 antiviral molecules with different structures and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, and the potential drug candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were analyzed. […] Tizoxanide, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and arbidol were found to have high binding energies, and they effectively bind key sites of the S1 and S2 subunits, inhibiting the virus by causing conformational changes in S1 and S2 during the fusion of the S protein with host cells. […] Based on the interactions among the drug molecules, the S protein and the amino acid environment around the binding sites, rational structure-based optimization was performed using the molecular connection method and bioisosterism strategy to obtain Ti-2, BD-2, and Ar-3, which have much stronger binding ability to the S protein than the original molecules.

Patients requiring surgical intervention who are positive for COVID-19 are not only more likely to develop complications post-operatively, but also pose an increased infection risk to the surgical team involved in their care. […] We present a case series (compliant with SCARE [4] and PROCESS [5] criteria) to demonstrate the effective use of an AR technology platform during the intraoperative treatment of two complex COVID positive patients diagnosed with Fournier’s gangrene.Retrospective review of prospectively collected data of all patients that required surgery involving multiple specialties during the COVID-19 pandemic at Jaber AlAhmad hospital in Kuwait between March 2020 to October 2020. […] We present two cases to highlight the use of an augmented reality (AR) platform during the treatment of COVID-19 positive patients with Fournier’s gangrene in order to safeguard surgical teams whilst simultaneously enabling these complex cases to benefit from multi-specialty input intraoperatively. […] This case series demonstrates how AR solutions can be employed to bolster infection control measures and may be useful in the treatment of surgical patients who test positive for COVID-19. […] AR solutions could be considered as an infection control strategy to safeguard surgical teams operating on COVID-19 positive patients.

No prophylactic treatments for COVID-19 have been clearly proven and found. […] In this pandemic context, cancer patients constitute a particularly fragile population that would benefit the best from such treatments, a present unmet need. […] In case of pandemic, if the protective effect of hormonal therapies will be proven on cancer patients, the use of specific hormonal therapies could be extended to other oncological groups and to healthy individuals to decrease the overall risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. […] Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) regulation is emerging as an important determinant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility. […] In our study, we analyzed AR and TMPRSS2 expression in 17,352 normal and 9,556 cancer tissues from public repositories and stratified data according to sex and age. […] The emerging picture is that some patient groups may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may benefit from antiandrogen- or tamoxifen-based therapies. […] These findings are relevant to choose proper treatments in order to protect cancer patients from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 contagion and related symptoms and put forward the idea that hormonal therapies could be used as prophylactic agents against COVID-19.

Yellow fever virus (YFV) live attenuated vaccine can, in rare cases, cause life-threatening disease, typically in patients with no previous history of severe viral illness. […] Autosomal recessive (AR) complete IFNAR1 deficiency was reported in one 12-yr-old patient. […] One 13-yr-old patient had AR complete IFNAR2 deficiency. […] AR IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 deficiency and neutralizing auto-Abs against type I IFNs thus accounted for more than half the cases of life-threatening YFV vaccine-associated disease studied here.

In this paper, we study the nonnegativity and stability properties of the solutions of a newly proposed extended SEIR epidemic model, the so-called SE(Is)(Ih)AR epidemic model which might be of potential interest in the characterization and control of the COVID-19 pandemic evolution. […] The proposed model incorporates both asymptomatic infectious and hospitalized infectious subpopulations to the standard infectious subpopulation of the classical SEIR model. […] In parallel, it also incorporates feedback vaccination and antiviral treatment controls. […] The exposed subpopulation has three different transitions to the three kinds of infectious subpopulations under eventually different proportionality parameters. […] Their local asymptotic stability properties and the attainability of the endemic equilibrium point are investigated based on the next generation matrix properties, the value of the basic reproduction number, and nonnegativity properties of the solution and its equilibrium states.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly become a global public health threat. […] Among these drugs, a second-generation antiandrogen agent, enzalutamide, was proposed because it reduces the expression of transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key component mediating SARS-CoV-2-driven entry, in prostate cancer cells. […] Tmprss2 knockout significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo. […] Enzalutamide effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in human prostate cells, however, such antiviral efficacy was lacking in human lung cells and organoids. […] Accordingly, enzalutamide showed no antiviral activity due to the AR-independent TMPRSS2 expression in mouse and human lung epithelial cells. […] Moreover, we observed distinct AR binding patterns between prostate cells and lung cells and a lack of direct binding of AR to TMPRSS2 regulatory locus in human lung cells.
