The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. […] Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus responsible for our recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, is driving a lung immunopathology that strongly resembles a severe form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). […] A review of recent Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 medical reports, as well as described characteristics of HP, lead us to postulate a theory for SARS-CoV-2 severe disease. […] We propose that the novel SARS-CoV-2 can act as a trigger and substrate of an HP-like severe immune reaction especially in genetically vulnerable individuals in addition to those with immune senescence and dysregulation. […] Accordingly, the purpose of our letter is to shift the emphasis of concern surrounding immune activity from viral infection to an HP-like severe immune reaction.

Hemoperfusion (HP) was helpful to prevent the development and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), liver failure, and septic shock by removing cytokines and other inflammatory mediators and ultimately preventing progression toward multiple organ failure. […] After 4 sessions of HP/continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRT), O2 saturation reached to 95%, and the patient was transferred to the general ward. […] Performing HP/CRRT at the early stages of ARDS can obviate the need for intubating patients with COVID-19. […] Punctual and early use of HP and CRRT in the treatment of ARDS in patients with COVID-19 prevented the progression of ARDS and patient intubation, reduced respiratory distress and the patient’s dependence on oxygen, prevented other complications such as AKI and septic shock in the patient, and reduced mortality and hospital length of stay.

This study aims to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a measure of moral injury (MI) symptoms for identifying clinically significant MI in health professionals (HPs), one that might be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. […] A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. […] Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. […] The 10-item MISS-HP measures 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10-100). […] Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. […] The MISS-HP is a reliable and valid measure of moral injury symptoms in health professionals that can be used in clinical practice to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment, as well as when conducting research that evaluates interventions to treat MI in HPs.

Healthcare professionals (HPs) are the key figures to keep up the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic and thus are one of the most vulnerable groups in this. […] This is the first study investigating German HPs after the COVID-19 outbreak. […] In total, 2224 HPs (physicians n = 492, nursing staff n = 1511, paramedics n = 221) and 10 639 non-healthcare professionals (nHPs) were assessed including generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), current health status (EQ-5D-3L), COVID-19-related fear, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19. […] HPs showed less generalized anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related fear and higher health status and subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 than the nHPs. […] Within the HP groups, nursing staff were the most psychologically burdened. […] Among HPs, nursing staff showed the highest and paramedics the lowest generalized anxiety levels. […] In the context of COVID-19, German HPs seem to be less psychological burdened than nHPs, and also less burdened compared with existing international data.

We propose a new trend filtering method that is a variant of the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter, constrained by the number of possible kinks. […] We term it the sparse HP filter and apply it to daily data from five countries: Canada, China, South Korea, the UK and the US. […] We find that the sparse HP filter provides a fewer kinks than the ℓ 1 trend filter, while both methods fitting data equally well. […] Theoretically, we establish risk consistency of both the sparse HP and ℓ 1 trend filters.

[…] The study included 486 patients (males 61 %; median age, 70 years): 247 patients in HP (COVID-19 prevalence 94 %) and 239 patients in MP (COVID-19 prevalence 45 %). […] In HP and MP respectively, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 90-95 %, 43-69 %, 96-72 %, 20-95 % for CT and 94-93 %, 7-31 %, 94-52 %, 7-83 % for LUS. […] CT demonstrated better performance than LUS in diagnosis of COVID-19, both in HP (AUC 0.75 vs 0.51; P &lt; 0.001) and MP (AUC 0.85 vs 0.62; P &lt; 0.001).

We report a preliminary experience of adjuvant therapy with Hemoperfusion (HP) in patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pneumonia. […] In a scenario of dramatic medical emergency, we conducted an observational study on 9 consecutive patients hospitalized in COVID Intensive Care Unit, where 5 of 9 consecutive patients were treated with HP, due to the emergency overload made it impossible to deliver blood purification in the other 4 patients. […] HP was started in all patients 6-7 days after hospital admission. […] The treated patients (T) received 2 consecutive sessions of HP using CytoSorb cartridge. […] IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α decreased after HP, IL-10 did not change. […] The limited sample size and observational study design preclude a sound statement about the potential effectiveness of HP in COVID-19 patients, but our experience suggests a potential therapeutic role of adjuvant CytoSorb HP in the early course of CO-VID-19 pneumonia.

Moral injury among physicians and other health professionals has attracted attention in the mainstream literature, this study aim to assess the psychometric properties of the 10-item Moral Injury Symptoms Scale-Health Professional (MISS-HP) among healthcare professionals in China. […] An online survey was conducted from March 27 to April 26, 2020 (during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic) using the Chinese version of the MISS-HP. […] The MISS-HP demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity in a large sample of physicians and nurses in mainland China, supporting its use as a screening measure for moral injury symptoms among increasingly stressed health professionals in this country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to the wide range of viability on inanimate surfaces and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2, hydrogen peroxide (0.5%, HP) and hypochlorite-based (0.1%, HC) disinfectants (common biocides) are proposed by World Health Organization to mitigate the spread of this virus in healthcare settings. […] Therefore, we use the “toxicity calculated ratio (TC ratio)” that refers to the fold increase or decrease in the toxicities reported in the literature (NOEC, LOEC, LC50 and EC50) relative to the WHO-recommended dose of HP and HC. […] Our results were collected via PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis) guidelines and showed that the TC ratios are from the single digits to several thousand-fold lower than the HP and HC recommended dose, which means these disinfectants are potentially dangerous to non-target organisms. […] The results also showed that HP and HC are toxic to the growth and reproduction of non-target organisms.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of extracorporeal endotoxin removal by Polymyxin B hemoperfusion (PMX-HP), in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and secondary bacterial infection. […] We included 12 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from nasal/oral swab, admitted to the intensive care unit between February and May 2020, who were affected by septic shock and received PMX-HP as per clinical indication of the attending physician. […] Septic shock was diagnosed in nine patients (75%), with a median time between symptoms onset and PMX-HP treatment of 16 (14-22) days. […] Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score progressively improved over the next 120 hours following PMX-HP and it was associated with median endotoxin activity assay (EAA) decrease from 0.78 [0.70-0.92] at T0 to 0.60 [0.44-0.72] at T120 (P = .245). […] In a series of consecutive COVID-19 patients with endotoxic shock, PMX-HP was associated with organ function recovery, hemodynamic improvement, and contemporary EAA level reduction. […] No PMX-HP-related complications were observed.

Our previous studies have reported that 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified chicken ovalbumin (HP-OVA) serves as a viral entry inhibitor to prevent several kinds of virus infection. […] Here, our results reveal that HP-OVA can effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication and S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in a dose-dependent manner without obvious cytopathic effects. […] Further analysis suggests that HP-OVA can bind to both the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2, and disrupt the S protein-ACE2 interaction, thereby exhibiting inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] In summary, our findings suggest that HP-OVA can serve as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of deadly COVID-19.
