[…] Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. […] CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=-2.647, -2.171, P˂0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, -2.177, P˂0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=-0.068, -1.549, P˂0.05).

[…] The respiratory performance (PaO2/FiO2) showed a strong inverse correlation with LDH (r = 0.62, r<sup>2</sup> 0.38, p value &lt; 0.0001) and CRP (r = 0.55, r<sup>2</sup> 0.31, p value &lt; 0.0001). […] ROC curves showed a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 70% for the LDH cut-off value of 450 U/L and a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 71% for the CRP cut-off value of 11 mg/dl in identifying CoVID-19 with moderate-severe ARDS. […] LDH and CRP may be related to respiratory function (PaO2/FiO2) and be a predictor of respiratory failure in CoVID-19 patients. […] LDH and CRP should be considered a useful test for the early identification of patients who require closer respiratory monitoring and more aggressive supportive therapies to avoid poor prognosis.

The results demonstrated that severe patients tend to present with increased white blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), procalcitonin (PCT), C-reaction protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and a decreased number of total lymphocyte and lymphocyte subtypes, such as CD4+ T lymphocyte and CD8+ T lymphocyte, compared to the non-severe patients. […] In addition, the WBC count&gt;10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, lymphocyte count&lt;1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, PCT&gt;0.5 ng/mL, and CRP&gt;10 mg/L were risk factors for disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (WBC count&gt;10 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L: OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.96-4.35; lymphocyte count&lt;1 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L: OR = 4.97, 95% CI: 3.53-6.99; PCT&gt;0.5 ng/mL: OR = 6.33, 95% CI: 3.97-10.10; CRP&gt;10 mg/L: OR = 3.51, 95% CI: 2.38-5.16). […] Furthermore, we found that NLR, as a novel marker of systemic inflammatory response, can also help predict clinical severity in patients with COVID-19 (OR = 2.50, 95% CI: 2.04-3.06). <b>Conclusions:</b> Immune-inflammatory parameters, such as WBC, lymphocyte, PCT, CRP, and NLR, could imply the progression of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel viral disease, are surprisingly high. […] Recently, we have developed CRP apheresis to selectively remove CRP from human plasma. […] CRP may contribute to organ failure and pulmonary fibrosis in SARS-CoV-2 infection by CRP-mediated complement and macrophage activation. […] CRP levels were ~200 mg/L. […] Two days after admission, CRP apheresis using the selective CRP adsorber (PentraSorb® CRP) was started. […] CRP apheresis was performed via peripheral venous access on days 2, 3, 4, and 5. […] Plasma CRP levels decreased by ~50% with peripheral (processed blood plasma ≤6000 mL) and by ~75% with central venous access (processed blood plasma ≤8000 mL), respectively. […] After the 2-day interruption in apheresis, CRP levels rapidly re-increased (&gt;400 mg/L) and the patient developed laboratory signs of multi-organ failure. […] When CRP apheresis was restarted, CRP levels and creatinine kinases (CK/CK-MB) declined again. […] CONCLUSIONS This is the first report on CRP apheresis in a SARS-CoV-2 patient. […] SARS-CoV-2 may cause multi-organ failure in part by inducing an excessive CRP-mediated autoimmune response of the ancient innate immune system.

Elder age, underlying comorbidities, and increased laboratory variables, such as leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) on admission, were found in survived severe cases compared to nonsevere cases. […] According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, elder age, a higher number of affected lobes, elevated CRP levels on admission, increased prevalence of chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were independent risk factors for death of severe patients. […] Dynamic changes of laboratory findings of survived severe cases and nonsurvived cases during hospital stay showed that continuing increase of leukocytes and neutrophil count, sustained lymphopenia and eosinopenia, progressing decrease in platelet count, as well as high levels of NLR, CRP, PCT, AST, BUN, and serum creatinine were associated with in-hospital death. […] Elder age, increased number of affected lobes, higher levels of serum CRP, chest tightness/dyspnea, and smoking history were risk factors for mortality of severe COVID-19 patients.

To investigate the value of the combined detection of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein level (CRP) in the diagnosis of COVID-19. […] Age, gender, white blood cell count (WBC), CRP, lymphocyte percentage, and NLR were extracted. […] We found that the NLR and CRP were higher, while the lymphocyte percentage was lower in patients with COVID-19 than in healthy controls. […] Among patients confirmed to have COVID-19, the NLR and CRP of the moderate group were lower than those of severely ill patients (severe, critical and death groups), and the lymphocyte percentage of the moderate group was higher than that of the critical and death group. […] Logistic regression analysis showed that the NLR, CRP, and lymphocyte percentage were independent risk factors for COVID-19. […] The AUC of the combined determination of NLR and CRP was 0.863, which was higher than that of NLR, CRP, WBC, and lymphocyte percentage (AUC: 0.835, 0.775, 0.416, and 0.749, respectively). […] Our results showed that the NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for COVID-19, and the combined detection of the NLR and CRP showed improved diagnostic performance for COVID-19.

[…] Moreover, the smooth curve fitting graph reflected that the severity of COVID-19 was positively correlated with both age and CRP levels (all P value &lt; 0.05). […] The health care professionals treating the COVID-19 patients should be aware of the increased likelihood of progression to severe COVID-19 in elderly patients and those with high CRP levels.

Correlation analysis and structural equation model were used to explore the relationships between ACE, sleep quality, anxiety symptom, serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and suicide ideation. […] The mediating roles of sleep quality, anxiety symptoms, and CRP levels on the influence of ACE on suicide ideation were explored. […] ACE was positively related to anxiety symptoms, CRP levels, and suicide ideation, and negatively related to sleep quality. […] Anxiety symptoms and CRP levels were positively related to suicide ideation, while sleep quality was negatively related to suicide ideation. […] Anxiety symptoms were positively related to CRP levels but negatively related to sleep quality. […] From these results, we found ACE affected suicide ideation directly and was mediated by roles sleep quality, anxiety symptom and CRP.

This study was designed to assess the levels of human serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to determine their prognostic value in predicting the severity of disease. […] For example, the patients were older, and had higher levels of inflammatory indicators [i.e., levels of CRP, SAA, procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6; CRP-to-PCT ratio; SAA-to-CRP ratio; and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)], higher inflammatory cell counts (i.e., white blood cell count and neutrophil count), and lower lymphocyte counts compared with patients without ARDS. […] Patients without ARDS still exhibited mild illness and had elevated SAA levels but not CRP levels. […] In patients with elevated SAA and CRP levels, the NLR was statistically associated with disease severity. […] According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the combined predictive probability of CRP and SAA levels, along with white blood cell count, showed the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.878), and was able to distinguish between patients with and without ARDS. […] For patients with elevated levels of SAA but not CRP, a mild condition was predicted. […] For patients with elevated levels of both SAA and CRP, and a high NLR, a severe infection was predicted, requiring medical attention. […] Therefore, CRP and SAA levels demonstrate a prognostic value for predicting the severity of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to determine the effect of C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytes (LYM), and the ratio of CRP to LYM (CRP/LYM) on assessing the prognosis of COVID-19 severity at early stages of disease. […] CRP increased and LYM decreased in the severe group.The results for the areas under the curve (AUC) of CRP/LYM and CRP used to assess severe COVID-19 were 0.787 (95% CI 0.698-0.860, P&lt;0.0001) and 0.781 (95% CI 0.693-0.856, P&lt;0.0001), respectively; both results were better than that of LYM. […] The associated criterion value of CRP/LYM was calculated, with an excellent sensitivity of 95.83%. […] CONCLUSIONS The effect of CRP/LYM and CRP on the assessment for severe COVID-19 may be superior to LYM alone. […] CRP/LYM is a highly sensitive indicator to assess the severity of COVID-19 in the early stage of disease.

Examination of C-reactive protein (CRP) trends reveals that a rapid rise in CRP levels precedes respiratory deterioration and intubation, although CRP levels plateau in patients who remain stable. […] Increasing CRP during the first 48 h of hospitalization is a better predictor (with higher sensitivity) of respiratory decline than initial CRP levels or ROX indices (a physiological score of respiratory function). […] CRP, the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6), and physiological measures of hypoxemic respiratory failure are correlated, which suggests a mechanistic link.

[…] The median CRP during hospitalization for the entire cohort was 130 mg/L (IQR 82-191 mg/L), and the median CRP on ICU admission was 169 (IQR 111-234). […] The hospitalization-wide median CRP was significantly higher amongst the patients who died, compared to those who survived [206 mg/L (157-288 mg/L) vs 114 mg/L (72-160 mg/L), p&lt;0.001].

NLR and CRP are established markers that reflect systemic inflammatory, and these parameters alter in patients with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia (COVID-19). […] The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including NLR and CRP levels, was collected. […] Pearson analysis was used to assess the independent relationship between the NLR with disease severity and CRP levels. […] Plasma CRP levels were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases, and this difference was significant. […] The results showed that NLR was positively correlated with CRP levels (R=0.23) and negatively correlated with WBC (R=-0.38). […] CRP (AUC = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99) and NLR (AUC = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81-0.93) had very good accuracy in predicting the severity of COVID-19 disease. […] The findings of this study indicated that the integration of NLR and CRP may lead to improved predictions and is recommended as a valuable early marker to assess prognosis and evaluate the severity of clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients.

To identify predictors of clinical improvement and intubation/death in tocilizumab-treated severe COVID19, focusing on IL6 and CRP longitudinal monitoring. 173 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia receiving tocilizumab in Reggio Emilia province Hospitals between 11 March and 3 June 2020 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. […] CRP and IL-6 levels were determined before TCZ administration (T0) and after 3 (T3), and 7 (T7) days. […] At multivariate analysis T0 and T3 CRP levels were negatively associated with clinical improvement (OR 0.13, CI 0.03-0.55 and OR 0.11, CI 0.0-0.46) (p=0.006 and p=0.003) and positively associated with intubation/death (OR 17.66, CI 2.47-126.14 and OR 5.34, CI: 1.49-19.12) (p=0.01 and p=0.004). […] General linear model analyses for repeated measures showed significantly different trends for CRP from day 3 to day 7 between patients who improved and those who did not, and between patients who were intubated or died and those who were not (p&lt;0.0001 for both).

Aim Development of a novel scale for assessing medical state in patients with new coronavirus infection based on clinical and laboratory disease severity’s markers, named SHOKS-COVID scale.Material and Methods Clinical Assessment Scale (SHOKS-COVID) is based on1: clinical parameters (respiratory rate, Body temperature, SpO2 need and type of ventilation support) 2: Inflammation markers (C reactive protein (CRP) and prothrombotic marker (D-dimer)) and 3: percent of lungs injury by CT. […] SHOKS-COVID scale was also compared against some additional biomarkers and with length of hospital stay.Results In patients with severe COVID-19 (Clinical Trial WAYFARER - 34 patients), SHOKS-COVID scores were correlated with the degree of inflammation: CRP (r = 0.64; p &lt;0.0001); the ratio lymphocytes / CRP (r = - 0.64; p &lt;0.0001). […] In patients with mild course (BISQUIT Study - 103 patients), SHOKS-COVID scores had a statistically significant positive correlation with length of fever (r = 0.37; p = 0.0002) and length of stay in the clinic (r = 0.52, p &lt;0.0001) and negatively correlated with the ratio of lymphocytes / CRP (-0.78, p &lt;0.0001) and the level of CRP (r=0.78; p &lt;0.0001).

The inflammatory markers were blood C-reactive protein level (CRP), neutrophil to lymphocyte, and platelet to lymphocyte ratios. […] We identified strong correlations between CRP (P &lt; .01) and the other inflammatory markers recorded on admission (P &lt; .001) with mean BP within 3 days after admission in normotensive patients, whereas these correlations were absent in patients with hypertension. […] Also, we observed after multivariate adjustment (P &lt; .05) that CRP level predicted a worse prognosis in hypertensive patients (relative risk 2.52; 95% confidence intervals [1.03- 6.17]; P = .04), whereas CRP was not predictive of outcome in patients without hypertension.

[…] To examine the status of CRPs during the COVID-19 pandemic, a web-based questionnaire was completed by CRP managers from April 23rd to May 14th, 2020. […] CRPs transitioned from group-based to one-to-one delivery models-&gt;80% by phone and/or e-mail. […] Any tele-rehabilitation (one-to-one/group) was also used by 32.7% and 43.5% of CRPs to deliver exercise and education, respectively (mostly one-to-one). […] Resource barriers cited by open and closed CRPs were related to technology-no tele-rehabilitation, lack of equipment and patient access (35% of all barriers)-and 25.3% of barriers were owing to greater demands on staff time. […] Within 2-months of COVID-19 being declared a pandemic, 41.2% of CRPs were closed and almost half of employees redeployed.

[…] The lowest scores ( score of 1) are assigned to biomarker changes (e.g. change in troponin, change in CRP). […] Secondary endpoints : The key secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary components and include the following: death, transfer to ICU primarily for invasive ventilation, transfer to ICU for other indication, non-fatal MACE ( any of following, MI, stroke, acute HF, new onset Afib), length of stay &gt; 4 days, development of acute kidney injury ( &gt; 40% decline in eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine), urgent intravenous treatment for high blood pressure, 30% increase in baseline high sensitivity troponin, 30% increase in baseline BNP, increase in CRP to &gt; 30% in 48 hours and lymphocyte count drop&gt; 30%. […] In particular, we will assess the impact of alternative schedules on primary and secondary endpoints including increases to baseline CRP and lymphocyte counts.
