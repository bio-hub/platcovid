Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. […] The route of transmission was by close contact with family members (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%) patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic (ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). […] Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin (six [17%]). […] Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19 were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine kinase MB.

In this study, we detected and analyzed the main laboratory indicators related to heart injury, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB), myohemoglobin (MYO), cardiac troponin I (ultra-TnI), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), in 273 patients with COVID-19 and investigated the correlation between heart injury and severity of the disease. […] It was found that higher concentration in venous blood of CK-MB, MYO, ultra-TnI, and NT-proBNP were associated with the severity and case fatality rate of COVID-19.

We performed a systematic literature search across Pubmed, Embase and pre-print from December 1, 2019 to March 27, 2020, to identify all observational studies that reported cardiac specific biomarkers (troponin, creatine kinase-MB fraction, myoglobin, or NT-proBNP) during COVID-19 infection. […] More severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher mean troponin (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.75, p &lt; 0.001), with a similar trend for creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and NT-proBNP.

With the rapid increase in the number of infections, children with COVID-19 appear to be rising.

Since the December 2019 discovery of several cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China, the infection has spread worldwide. […] Compared with those in the M group, lymphocyte count (LYM) decreased significantly in the SC group, while the serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), creatinine (Cre), D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), myoglobin (MB) and troponin I (cTnl) increased significantly in the SC group (P &lt; .05). […] The combined use of three or more antiviral drugs is to be avoided. […] The combination of broad-spectrum antibacterial drugs is not recommended and the risk of drug-induced liver injury should be monitored.

The large number of patients requiring intensive care threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems globally. […] Here, an integrated point-of-care COVID-19 Severity Score and clinical decision support system is presented using biomarker measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), N-terminus pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), myoglobin (MYO), D-dimer, procalcitonin (PCT), creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB), and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). […] The COVID-19 Severity Score combines multiplex biomarker measurements and risk factors in a statistical learning algorithm to predict mortality. […] Although this analysis represents patients with cardiac comorbidities (hypertension), the inclusion of biomarkers from other pathophysiologies implicated in COVID-19 (e.g., D-dimer for thrombotic events, CRP for infection or inflammation, and PCT for bacterial co-infection and sepsis) may improve future predictions for a more general population.

The most common laboratory abnormalities were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (median [IQR], 16.0 [12.0-26.0] U/L), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (median [IQR], 30.0 [23.0-41.8] U/L), creatine kinase MB (CK-MB) activity (median [IQR], 24.0 [18.0-34.0] U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (median [IQR], 243.0 [203.0-297.0] U/L), which are associated with liver and myocardial injury. […] There was no statistically significant difference in absolute number of lymphocytes (including T cells and B cells) between mild and moderate cases, but moderate cases were associated with a decrease in neutrophil levels compared with mild cases (median [IQR], 2310/μL [1680/μL-3510/μL] vs 3120/μL [2040/μL-4170/μL]; P = .01).

Elevation of cardiac biomarkers, particularly high-sensitivity troponin and/or creatine kinase MB, is common in patients with COVID-19 infection. […] The plausible mechanisms of myocardial injury include, 1) hyperinflammation and cytokine storm mediated through pathologic T-cells and monocytes leading to myocarditis, 2) respiratory failure and hypoxemia resulting in damage to cardiac myocytes, 3) down regulation of ACE2 expression and subsequent protective signaling pathways in cardiac myocytes, 4) hypercoagulability and development of coronary microvascular thrombosis, 5) diffuse endothelial injury and ‘endotheliitis’ in several organs including heart, and, 6) inflammation and/or stress causing coronary plaque rupture or supply-demand mismatch leading to myocardial ischemia/infarction.

Methylene blue (MB, oxidized form, blue color) has been used in many different areas of clinical medicine, ranging from malaria to orthopedics. […] Leucomethylene Blue (reduced form of MB, colorless) may be applied for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the scientific evidences. […] In human body, MB first induces OS through absorbing electron (like a free radical) from other molecules, if the body could counteract to this OS, then reduced MB decreases OS through other mechanisms. […] Reduced MB could prevent inflammation, propagation of the virus RNA, and also improves hypoxia through reducing methemoglobin. […] Therefore, to avoid the increment of OS, we suggest using Leucomethylene Blue through the following protocol: The IV cocktail contains 50 mg MB (1mg/kg, 50-kg weight), 1000-2000 mg vitamin C, 500-1000 mg N-Acetylcysteine (or glutathione or cysteine or α-lipoic acid) and 10-20 gr urea (optional) in 100 ml dextrose 5%.

[…] The average activation energy was 246.5 and 268.51 kJ/mol for the SY and MB devolatilization, respectively. […] MB appeared to exhibit a better pyrolysis performance with a higher degradation rate and less residues. […] The most suitable reaction mechanisms belonged to a geometrical contraction model (R2) for the SY pyrolysis and to a nucleation growth model (A1.2) for the MB pyrolysis.

The severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in December 2019, and rapidly spread to other provinces in China as well as other countries. […] In the non-surviving group, the number of white blood cells (WBC) was significantly increased and lymphocytes were decreased, and the lymphopenia was more common. […] The levels of aspartate transaminase (AST), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were also significantly increased in the non-surviving group. […] Patients with lymphopenia, and high level of WBC, AST, BNP, CK-MB, LDH, and CRP may be more likely to deteriorate.

[…] (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31.25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68.75%) were critical COVID-19; 62.50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease; the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90.91% (10/11) and 45.46% (5/11) respectively.

Since the outbreak in late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. […] Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;90 g/L (hazard ratio, 10.776; 95% confidence interval, 3.075-37.766; p&lt;0.0001), creatine kinase (CK-MB) &gt;8 U/L (9.155; 2.424-34.584; p = 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) &gt;245 U/L (5.963; 2.029-17.529; p = 0.001), procalcitonin (PCT) &gt;0.5 ng/ml (7.080; 1.671-29.992; p = 0.008), and CT score &gt;10 (39.503; 12.430-125.539; p&lt;0.0001) were independent risk factors for the mortality of COVID-19.
