Traditional Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) have unique roles in the treatment of viral infections. […] In this article we analyzed the effectiveness and possible molecular mechanisms of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19. […] The active ingredients and action targets of CHM formulas were obtained from the TCMSP database. […] The action mechanisms of these genes were predicted using a Gene Ontology (GO)-based functional enrichment and annotation tool and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). […] CHM formulas played a positive role in preventing COVID-19 and warrant further application. […] Our research provides new evidence to support the possible value of CHM formulas for the prevention of COVID-19.

In addition, we also summarized preclinical rationale for anti-coronavirus activity by TCM in terms of virion assembly and release, as well as viral entry and replication, which could be a useful contribution for figuring out effective Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for coronavirus, including ingredients from single monomeric compounds, Chinese herbs, Chinese herb extracts and Chinese herb formulas, or potential targets for medicine. […] We would like to see these relevant studies, ranging from basic researches to clinical application, could provide some idea on effects of CHM to combat COVID-19 or other coronaviruses, and also offer new thinking for the exploration of therapeutic strategies under the guidance of TCM.

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) was also included as part of the treatment plans at various stages of COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. […] Eligible adult patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CHM plus standard care or standard care alone for 7 days. […] The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment. <b>Results:</b> Between Jan 31, 2020, and Feb 19, 2020, 42 out of 100 screened patients were included in the trial: 28 in the CHM plus standard care group and 14 in the standard care alone group. […] For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148-2.352, <i>P</i> = 0.454). […] Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. […] 7.14% (1/28) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. <b>Conclusions:</b> For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. […] The effects of CHM in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> <a href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx" class="uri">http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx</a>.

The use of Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) might have a role in the treatment and symptomatic management of patients with COVID-19. […] It was aimed at providing an overview of the available evidence and ongoing trials concerning the effects of CHMs for the treatment of COVID-19. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> This is a narrative review of relevant studies. […] Four guidelines provided recommendations on the use of CHMs; these guidelines were developed in China and South Korea and were based on the consensus of experts exclusively. […] The remaining 21 guidelines provided no guidance on CHMs. […] No finished RCTs of CHMs for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 was found. […] According to the evidence evaluated in this review, a Cochrane review of CHMs for severe acute respiratory syndrome and five uncontrolled observational studies of the effects of CHMs in patients with COVID-19, the effects of CHMs for COVID-19 are unknown. […] A total of 52 ongoing clinical trials of CHM interventions for the treatment of COVID-19 were found. […] Forty-seven trials (90%) will have a sample size &lt;400 participants. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> To the authors’ knowledge, only the Chinese and the South Korean guidelines recommend CHMs as a treatment option for patients with COVID-19. […] Clinical guidelines or health authorities from other countries do not provide advice on CHMs. […] Due to the absence of RCT, there is currently no reliable evidence on the effects of any specific CHM intervention for the treatment of patients with COVID-19.

However, It is worth noting that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), especially Chinese herbal medicine (CHM), has been widely applied in mainland China since outbreak, bringing new hope for the prevention and control of COVID-19. […] A comprehensive literature searching was conducted in 7 electronic databases from their inception up to June 21, 2020 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CHM for COVID-19. […] Most of CHMs were originated from classical Chinese herbal formulas. […] Our meta-analyses found that comparing CHM group and conventional western medicine group, CHM group has improvements in several clinical parameters including lung CT, clinical cure rate, ranging from mild to critical cases, length of hospital stay, total score of clinical symptoms, fever reduction time, symptom score of fever, number of cough reduction cases, symptom score of cough, number of fatigue reduction cases, symptom score of fatigue, disappearing time of fatigue, TCM syndrome, viral nucleic acid testing, and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein). […] Besides, no severe adverse effects was identified by CHM. […] CHM, especially classical Chinese herbal formulas, could be used as potential candidates for COVID-19 in this battle.

To seek potential Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) through the molecular docking of the medicine with SARS-CoV-2 3CL hydrolytic enzyme and the angiotensin converting enzyme II(ACE2) as receptors, using computer virtual screening technique, so as to provide a basis for combination forecasting. […] The molecular docking of CHM with the SARS-Cov-2 3CL hydrolase and the ACE2 converting enzyme, which were taken as the targets, was achieved by the Autodock Vina software. […] The CHM monomers acting on 3CLpro and ACE2 receptors were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform, the active ingredients were selected, and the key CHMs and compounds were speculated. […] Based on the perspective of network pharmacology, the chemical-target network was constructed, and the functional enrichment analysis of gene ontology and the pathway enrichment analysis of Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes were carried out by DAVID to speculate about the mechanism of action of the core drug pairs. […] Among 238 potential anti-COVID-19 herbs screened in total, 16 kinds of CHM containing the most active ingredients, and 5 candidate anti-COVID-19 herbs that had been used in high frequency, as well as a core drug pair, namely, Forsythiae Fructus-Lonicerae Japonicae Flos were selected.

In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the epidemic disease concepts of “febrile epidemics” (wenyi) or “warm diseases” (wenbing) are based on geographic and cultural aspects, and Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) played an important role in the treatment of epidemic diseases. […] CHM was widely used to treat patients suffered with SARS almost two decades ago during outbreak of SARS, with proven safety and potential benefits. […] We propose the use of CHM treatment principles for clinical practice, based on four main stages of COVID-19 infection: early, intermediate, severe, and convalescence. […] We summarize the pharmaceutical mechanisms of CHM for treating coronavirus via antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects.

This systematic review and meta-analysis summarized contemporary studies that report the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) to treat COVID-19. […] Further, included RCTs had a control group that was given standard care (SC; such as conventional Western medicine treatments or routine medical care), and a treatment group that was given SC plus CHM. […] Compared to SC alone, CHM plus SC had a superior effect on the change of symptom and sign score (-1.30 by SMD, 95% CI [-2.43, -0.16]; 3 studies; n = 261, P = 0.03), on inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP, mg/L; -11.82 by MD, 95% CI [-17.95, -5.69]; 5 studies; n = 325, P = 0.0002), on number of patients with improved lung CT scans (1.34 by risk ratio, 95% CI [1.19, 1.51]; 4 studies; n = 489, P &lt; 0.00001). […] Current evidence shows that CHM, as an adjunct treatment with standard care, helps to improve treatment outcomes in COVID-19 cases.

Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) is thought to be a potential intervention in the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). […] This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of CHM or CHM combination therapy for COVID-19. […] Randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies on CHM or CHM combination therapy for COVID-19 were included. […] Meta-analysis showed that the overall clinical effectiveness (OR = 2.67, 95% CI 1.83-3.89, I2 = 0%), improvement in the CT scan (OR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.80-3.29, I2 = 0%), percentage of cases turning to severe/critical (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.24-0.67, I2 = 17.1%), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity rate (OR = 2.55, 95% CI 1.06-6.17, I2 = 56.4%) and disappearance rate of symptoms (fever, cough, and fatigue) were superior by combined CHM treatment of COVID-19.

Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM), however, has rich experience in treating renal injury and has successfully applied in China in the battle of COVID-19. […] Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of CHM treatment are still unclear. […] This study provides therapeutic potentials of CHM to combat COVID-19 related renal injury to reduce complications and mortality.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) in patients with severe/critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] All patients were divided into an exposed group (CHM users) and a control group (non-users). […] After propensity score matching in a 1:1 ratio, 156 CHM users were matched by propensity score to 156 non-users. […] All-cause mortality was reported in 13 CHM users who died and 36 non-users who died. […] After multivariate adjustment, the mortality risk of CHM users was reduced by 82.2% (odds ratio 0.178, 95% CI 0.076-0.418; P &lt; 0.001) compared with the non-users. […] These results show that the use of CHM may reduce the mortality of patients with severe/critical COVID-19.
