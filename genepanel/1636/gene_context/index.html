The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. […] ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. […] Increased ACE and Ang II are poor prognostic factors for severe pneumonia. […] The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. […] The balance of the RAS system was broken, and this would lead to the exacerbation of acute severe pneumonia. […] Therefore, we speculate that ACEI and AT1R inhibitors could be used in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia under the condition of controlling blood pressure, and might reduce the pulmonary inflammatory response and mortality.

Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. […] ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. […] As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. […] ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. […] Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs. […] Moreover, there are no data to support the notion that ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker administration facilitates coronavirus entry by increasing ACE2 expression in either animals or humans. […] Indeed, animal data support elevated ACE2 expression as conferring potential protective pulmonary and cardiovascular effects.

This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the possible mechanisms. […] ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] The classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang 1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. […] ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. […] ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. […] Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. […] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. […] Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. […] Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. […] ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. […] Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. […] The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.

The discovery that SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2, which is highly expressed in the lower airways, explained why SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. […] After this, news spread that ACEis and ARBs would be harmful in SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects. […] To the contrary, compelling evidence exists that the ACE-1/angiotensin(Ang)II/ATR-1 pathway is involved in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS, while the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/ATR2/MasR pathway counteracts the harmful actions of AngII in the lung. […] A reduced ACE-1/ACE-2 ratio is, in fact, a feature of ARDS that can be rescued by human recombinant ACE-2 and Ang(1-7) administration, thus preventing SARS-CoV-2-induced damage to the lung. […] Based on the current clinical evidence treatment with ACE-inhibitors I (ACEis) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) continues to provide cardiovascular and renal protection in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

SARS-CoV2 host cell infection is mediated by the binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis downregulation, increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. […] Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. […] Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.

Some Authors recently suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) should be discontinued, even temporarily, given the current pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus. […] The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. […] ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. […] ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. […] The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. […] There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. […] Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. […] In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. […] In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. […] In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. […] This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. […] ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. […] ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. […] An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin<sub>1-7</sub>. […] Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. […] Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. […] Increased pulmonary inflammation and coagulation have been reported as unwanted effects of enhanced and unopposed angiotensin II effects via the ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis. […] Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. […] We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. […] The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2→Angiotensin<sub>1-7</sub>→Mas receptor axis. […] In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin<sub>1-7</sub> and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 which is present on nonimmune cells, such as respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells, endothelial cells, kidney cells (renal tubules) and cerebral neurons and immune cells, such as alveolar monocytes/macrophages [4-6]. […] Evidence has been provided that SARSCoV proteins are cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, respectively, and the amino acids 318-510 of the S1 represent the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which binds to ACE2 [10, 11]. […] Quite importantly, in the context of RBD there is the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424- 494), which accounts for complete binding to ACE2 [11]. […] In this respect, the sequence of COVID-19 RBM is similar to that of SARSCoV, thus, implicating that ACE2 may represent the binding receptors for COVID-19. […] Furthermore, gln493 residue of COVID-19 RBM seems to allow interaction with human ACE2, thus, suggesting the ability of this virus to infect human cells. […] According, to Wan and associates structural analysis [14], COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 with a lesser efficiency than human SARS-CoV (2002) but with higher affinity than human SARS-CoV (2003). […] Furthermore, same authors predicted that a single mutation at the 501 position may enhance the COVID-19 RBD binding capacity to human ACE2 and this evolution should be monitored in infected patients [14]. […] From a pathogenic point of view, evidence has been provided that binding of S2 to ACE2 receptor leads to its down-regulation with subsequent lung damage in the course of SARS-CoV infection [17]. […] Down-regulation of ACE2 causes excessive production of angiotensin (ANG) II by the related enzyme ACE with stimulation of ANG type 1a receptor (AT1R) and enhanced lung vascular permeability [18]. […] In particular, same authors have reported that recombinant ACE2 could attenuate severe acute lung injury in mice [18]. […] Moreover, Battle and associates [19] also proposed to use already available recombinant ACE2 for intercepting COVID-19 and attenuating infection. […] In the previous paragraphs, the presence of ACE2 on immune cells has been pointed out and, by analogy to epithelial cells, this receptor may also be down-regulated following viral entry. […] Therefore, in CoV-infected animal models and in infected humans further investigations are required to clarify a possible reduced expression of ACE2 on immune cells. […] There is evidence that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and operates as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [18, 37]. […] ACE2 counterbalances the noxious effects exhibited by ANG II and AT1R via activation of AT2R which arrests cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis [39]. […] In fact, losartan as well as olmesartan, used for treating hypertension in patients, were able to increase ACE2 expression after 28 days treatment of rats with myocardial infarction [41]. […] However, the putative effects of ACE-2 down-regulation on the cardiovascular system in the course of COVID-19 pandemic need more intensive studies. […] Taken together, these evidences suggest that CoV-induced down-regulation of ACE2 activates RAS with collateral damage to organs, such as lungs, in the course of SARS-related pneumonia. […] Then, putative therapeutic measures aimed at increasing ACE2 levels on respiratory epithelial cells should be taken into serious consideration. […] In all these experimental models, RES led to an increase of ACE2 with reduction of organ damage, such as liver steatosis and aorta media thickness and decrease of adipose tissue mass, respectively. […] In turn, Sirt1 down-regulates AT1R expression via ACE2 up-regulation [43, 48]. […] The data above discussed strongly suggest, that RES, as an activators of ACE2, should be investigated in animal models of CoV-induced severe pneumonia, also taking into account the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects exerted by polyphenols [49]. […] From a pharmacologic point of view, RAS inhibition leads to upregulation of ACE2, thus, attenuating acute respiratory syndrome and myocarditis in COVID-19-infected patients. […] Conversely, increase in ACE2 expression may facilitate the access into the host of COVID-19, thus, aggravating the clinical picture. […] In fact, there are no available data which support that ACE inhibitors or ANG II type I receptor blockers increase COVID-19 infection via its binding to ACE2. […] Finally, Kuster and associates [52] write that there are no data on the strict relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV2 mortality. […] Moreover, in the SARSCoV2, cells expressing ACE2 were not attacked by the virus, while cells lacking ACE2 were bound by the SARS-CoV2 virus [53]. […] These findings suggest that also in the case of RES effects on COVID-19 infection, the dual role of ACE2 should be taken into serious consideration.

The SARS-CoV-2 infects humans through the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor.

[…] In metabolic disorders and with increased age, it is known that there is an upregulation of ACE-Ang-II-AT<sub>1</sub>R axis with a downregulation of ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis. […] The activated ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis leads to pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects in respiratory system, vascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, and insulin secretory defects with increased insulin resistance. […] On the other hand, the ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis has anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects on the respiratory system and anti-inflammatory, antioxidative stress, and protective effects on vascular function, protects against myocardial fibrosis, nephropathy, pancreatitis, and insulin resistance. […] The already strained ACE-2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas in metabolic disorders is further stressed due to the use of the ACE-2 by the virus for entry, which affects the prognosis in terms of respiratory compromise.

The purpose of this article is to review and investigate further the molecular mechanism by which the SARS-CoV2 virus infection proceeds via the formation of a hetero-trimer between its protein S, the ACE2 receptor and the B0AT1 protein, which is the “entry receptor” for the infection process involving membrane fusion (Li et al., 2003). […] Then, using a logical evaluation of viral density that measures the rate at which the cells are hijacked by the virus (and they provide a place for the virus to replicate) and considering the “time delay” given by the interaction between cell and virus, the expected duration of the incubation period is predicted. […] The amino acid sequence of S proein and its interaction with the ACE-2 protein is mimicked with the aid of Hill function.

The virus invades the target cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and modulates the expression of ACE2 in host cells.

[…] We reviewed the literature that reported the distribution and function of ACE2 in the female reproductive system, hoping to clarify the potential harm of 2019-nCoV to female fertility. […] The available evidence suggests that ACE2 is widely expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina and placenta. […] Ang II, ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) regulate follicle development and ovulation, modulate luteal angiogenesis and degeneration, and also influence the regular changes in endometrial tissue and embryo development.

The relationship between Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) and COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular, RAS as part of the CoV-2 infection process via Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the entry point of SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in conflicting suggestions regarding how RAS and its role(s) should inform treating COVID-19. […] ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II (Ang)-type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), in fact, have been suggested to be avoided as they potentially upregulate ACE2 <sup>1</sup> and, conversely, there are suggestions that ARBs might be beneficial <sup>2</sup> as SARS-CoV-2 causing ACE2 downregulation slows the Ang II conversion to the vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic Ang 1-7 <sup>3-5</sup> , and the use of ARBs by blocking the excessive Ang II type-1 receptors activation, would be beneficial upregulating ACE2 activity and increasing Ang 1-7 levels.

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13]. […] The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS. […] The cellular targets of Angiotensin II are the vasoconstrictor type 1 (AT1R) and vasodilatator type 2 (AT2R) Angiotensin II receptors (AT1R is expressed at the surface of monocytes/macrophages and T-cells indicating that RAS acts on innate immunity in host). […] When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR). […] Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage. […] ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R. […] Interestingly, it appears that a ‘counter-regulatory’ RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively. […] It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency. […] The proposed molecules are (so far) ACE inhibitors (to prevent the production of Angiotensin II from Angiotensin I), and blockers/antagonists of AT1R such as Losartan and derivatives. […] Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. […] The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R.

When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) wreaked an unprecedented havoc of an escalating number of deaths and hospitalization in the United States, clinicians were faced with a myriad of unanswered questions, one of the them being the implication of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with COVID-19. […] Animal data and human studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the expression of ACE2. […] ACE2 is an enzyme found in the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung and is a coreceptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. […] Therefore, one can speculate that discontinuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy may lead to decreased ACE2 expression, thereby attenuating the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and mitigating the disease progression of COVID-19. […] However, several studies have also shown that ACE2 exhibits reno- and cardioprotection and preserves lung function in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which would favor ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. […] This article is to examine and summarize the 2 opposing viewpoints and provide guideline recommendations to support the use or discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19.

This article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). […] ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] The classical ACE-angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. […] ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. […] Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. […] ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. […] Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future. […] In the meantime, however, the use of RAS blockers such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers that inhibit the damaging (ACE-Ang II) arm of the RAS cascade in the lung may also be promising.

We showed ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 is higher in the kidney of male compared with female mice. […] To further investigate this sex difference, we examined the role of ACE2 in Ang-[1-8] (angiotensin [1-8])-induced hypertension and regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney of WT (wild type) and Ace2 KO (knockout) mice. […] This sex difference was attenuated in ACE2 KO mice. […] Ang-[1-8] infusion reduced glomerular AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) binding in WT female mice by 30%, and deletion of <i>Ace2</i> abolished this effect. […] In contrast, Ang-[1-8] infusion increased glomerular AT1R binding in WT male mice by 1.2-fold, and this effect of Ang-[1-8] persisted in Ace2 KO male mice (1.3-fold). […] ACE2 also had an effect on renal protein expression of the neutral endopeptidase NEP (neprilysin), the enzyme that catabolizes Ang-[1-10] (angiotensin [1-10]), the precursor of Ang-[1-8]. […] Deletion of Ace2 resulted in lowered NEP expression after Ang-[1-8] infusion in both sexes. […] These findings suggest sex-specific ACE2 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to female protection from Ang-[1-8]-induced hypertension. […] These findings have ramifications for the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, especially in hypertension since ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 receptor and hypertension is a major risk factor for poor outcomes.

The present research aimed to determine the relation between the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inh) and angiotensinogen receptor blockers (ARBs) and in-hospital mortality of hypertensive patients diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. […] All patients were on ACE inh/ARBs or other antihypertensive therapy unless no contraindication was present. […] In total, 113 hypertensive Covid-19 patients were included, of them 74 patients were using ACE inh/ARBs. […] The frequency of admission to the ICU and endotracheal intubation were significantly higher in patients using ACE inh/ARBs. […] In a multivariable analysis, the use of ACE inh/ARBs was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR: 3.66; 95%CI: 1.11-18.18; <i>p</i>= .032). […] Kaplan-Meir curve analysis displayed that patients on ACE inh/ARBs therapy had higher incidence of in-hospital death than those who were not. […] The present study has found that the use of ACE inh/ARBs therapy might be associated with an increased in-hospital mortality in patients who were diagnosed with Covid-19 pneumonia. […] It is likely that ACE inh/ARBs therapy might not be beneficial in the subgroup of hypertensive Covid-19 patients despite the fact that there might be the possibility of some unmeasured residual confounders to affect the results of the study.

The role of the ACE2 enzyme in the COVID-19 infection is 2-fold, with opposing implications for the disease development.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of pneumocytes, the hallmark of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involving both alveolar interstitium and capillaries, is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and its functional downregulation. […] ACE2 is a key enzyme for the balance between the two main arms of the RAS: the ACE/angiotensin (Ang) II/Ang II type 1 receptor axis (“classic RAS”) and the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis (“anti-RAS”). […] The ACE2 downregulation, as a result of SARS-coronaviruses binding, enhances the classic RAS, leading to lung damage and inflammation with leaky pulmonary blood vessels and fibrosis, when the attenuation mediated by the anti-RAS arm is reduced.

The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires the binding of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, well-known for its role in counteracting ACE. […] ACE2 is involved in modulating blood pressure and establishing blood pressure homeostasis. […] Recently, a critical debatable question has arisen whether using antihypertensive medications will have a favorable impact on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one, mainly because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy can modulate the expression of ACE2 protein. […] The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. […] On the other hand, several genetic association studies have examined the relationship between ACE2 genetic variants and the risk of developing hypertension in different ethnic populations. […] In this review, we discuss the ongoing arguments in the literature about ACE2’s role in mortality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients comorbid with hypertension and critically evaluate the current debate about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs. […] Moreover, we explore the two opposing roles that ACE2 genetic variants might be playing in COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 receptor effectiveness and mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

First, ACE and ACE2, genes that play key roles in SARS-CoV-2 infection, have some variants that are predicted to reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Second, mRNA for ACE2 is elevated and mRNA for TMPRSS2, a serine protease, is decreased in CF airway epithelial cells. […] Increased ACE2 is predicted to enhance SARS-CoV-2 binding to cells but would increase conversion of angiotensin II, which is proinflammatory, to angiotensin-1-7, which is anti-inflammatory. […] Thus, increased ACE2 would reduce inflammation and lung damage due to SARS-CoV-2.

Previously, we have shown that loss of angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) promotes the ACE/angiotensin-II (Ang-II)/angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis, a deleterious arm of RAS, unleashing its detrimental effects in diabetes. […] As suggested by the recent reports regarding the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), upon entry into the host, this virus binds to the extracellular domain of ACE2 in nasal, lung, and gut epithelial cells through its spike glycoprotein subunit S1. […] We put forth the hypothesis that during this process, reduced ACE2 could result in clinical deterioration in COVID-19 patients with diabetes via aggravating Ang-II-dependent pathways and partly driving not only lung but also bone marrow and gastrointestinal pathology.

There is current debate concerning the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), for hypertension management, during COVID-19 infection. […] Specifically, the suggestion has been made that ACE inhibitors or ARBs could theoretically contribute to infection via increasing ACE2 receptor expression and hence increase viral load. […] The ACE2 receptor is responsible for binding the SAR-CoV2 viral spike and causing COVID-19 infection. […] What makes the argument somewhat obtuse for ACE inhibitors or ARBs is that ACE2 receptor expression can be increased by compounds that activate or increase the expression of SIRT1. […] Henceforth common dietary interventions, vitamins and nutrients may directly or indirectly influence the cellular expression of the ACE2 receptor. […] There are many common compounds that can increase the expression of the ACE2 receptor including Vitamin C, Metformin, Resveratrol, Vitamin B3 and Vitamin D. […] It is important to acknowledge that down-regulation or blocking the cellular ACE2 receptor will likely be pro-inflammatory and may contribute to end organ pathology and mortality in COVID-19.

Since, children had been known to be less severely affected by the virus in part due to the higher concentration of Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptor, this presentation has emerged concerns regarding the infection of children with SARS-COV2. […] ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1-7). […] ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. […] Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. […] It appears that TNF- α might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. […] Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-α and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-α and progression to Kawasaki-like disease.

An association among the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) with the clinical outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unclear. […] PubMed, EMBASE, MedRxiv, and BioRxiv were searched for relevant studies that assessed the association between application of ACEI/ARB and risk of COVID-19, inflammation level, severity COVID-19 infection, and death in patients with COVID-19. […] ACEI/ARB therapy might be associated with the reduced inflammatory factor (interleukin-6) and elevated immune cells counts (CD3, CD8). […] Meta-analysis showed no significant increase in the risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.89-1.05) in patients receiving ACEI/ARB therapy, and ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with a decreased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR: 0.75, 95%CI: 0.59-0.96) and mortality (OR: 0.52, 95%CI: 0.35-0.79).

The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. […] We propose that COVID-19 is a viral multisystem disease, with dominant vascular pathology, mediated by global reduction in ACE2 function, pronounced in disease conditions with RAS bias toward angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) over ACE2. […] It is further complicated by organ specific pathology related to loss of ACE2 expressing cells particularly affecting the endothelium, alveolus, glomerulus and cardiac microvasculature. […] The possible upregulation in ACE2 receptor expression may predispose individuals with aberrant RAS status to higher viral load on infection and relatively more cell loss. […] Relative ACE2 deficiency leads to enhanced and protracted tissue, and vessel exposure to angiotensin II, characterised by vasoconstriction, enhanced thrombosis, cell proliferation and recruitment, increased tissue permeability, and cytokine production (including IL-6) resulting in inflammation.

ACE2, an 805-amino acid monocarboxypeptidase type I transmembrane glycoprotein, was discovered in 2000 and has sequence similarity to two other proteins, namely ACE and collectrin.

[…] Animal studies have found that ACE2 is central in diseases affecting almost all organ systems, among other cardiac, respiratory, renal and endocrine functions. […] ACE2 was identified as the cellular contact point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the global pandemic (COVID-19), and is a potential drug target. […] We describe the genetics and functions of ACE2, explore its various physiological functions in the renin-angiotensin system and discuss its role in the pathophysiology of disease. […] ACE2 opposes the vasopressor ACE pathway of the renin-angiotensin system by converting angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang (1-9) and Ang II to Ang (1-7) which initiates the vasodilatory pathway. […] ACE2 may have a protective effect in the lung and kidney as knockout mice display susceptibility to acute respiratory distress and hypertensive nephropathy.

[…] Some authors proposed the discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs for cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic diseases, while expert opinions have discouraged that due to limited empirical evidence of their negative effect on COVID-19 outcomes, and that withdrawing treatment may contribute to clinical decompensation in high-risk patients.

The magnitude of the outbreak and the potentially severe clinical course of COVID-19 has led to a burst of scientific research on this novel coronavirus and its host receptor ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)-2. […] ACE2 is a homolog of the ACE that acts on several substrates in the renin-Ang (angiotensin) system. […] With unprecedented speed, scientific research has solved the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and imaged its binding with the ACE2 receptor. […] In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viral S (spike) protein receptor-binding domain binds to ACE2 to enter the host cell. […] ACE2 expression in the lungs is relatively low, but it is present in type II pneumocytes-a cell type also endowed with TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2). […] This protease is critical for priming the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to complex with ACE2 and enter the cells. […] Herein, we review the current understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 as it has rapidly unfolded over the last months. […] While it should not be assumed that we have a complete picture of SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection and its interaction with ACE2, much has been learned with clear therapeutic implications.

[…] The fact that respiratory and vascular epithelial cells express ACE-2 has been previously observed during the 2003 epidemic of the SARS-CoV-1 in China, and during the 2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome in Saudi Arabia.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc membrane metallopeptidase that plays a key role in regulating vasoactive peptide levels and hence cardiovascular activity through its conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang II and its metabolism of bradykinin. […] The discovery of its homologue, ACE2, 20 years ago has led to intensive comparisons of these two enzymes revealing surprising structural, catalytic and functional distinctions between them. […] ACE2 plays multiple roles not only as a vasopeptidase but also as a regulator of amino acid transport and serendipitously as a viral receptor, mediating the cellular entry of the coronaviruses causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and, very recently, COVID-19. […] Catalytically, ACE2 functions as a monocarboxypeptidase principally converting the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II to the vasodilatory peptide Ang-(1-7) thereby counterbalancing the action of ACE on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and providing a cardioprotective role. […] Unlike ACE, ACE2 does not metabolise bradykinin nor is it inhibited by classical ACE inhibitors. […] Interest in ACE2 biology and its potential as a possible therapeutic target has surged in recent months as the COVID-19 pandemic rages worldwide.

Background SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) utilizes the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor to enter human cells. […] Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARB) are associated with ACE-2 upregulation. […] We hypothesized that antecedent use of ACEI/ARB may be associated with mortality in COVID-19. […] Among these 781 acutely ill patients, 133 (17.0%) used an ARB and 171 (21.9%) used an ACEI. […] While neither sex nor smoking status differed by user groups, patients on ACEI/ARB tended to be older and more likely to have hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. […] The crude odds ratios (ORs) for death for ACEI users and ARB users were 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60-1.60, p=0.9333, and 1.13, 95% CI: 0.67-1.91, p=0.6385, respectively. […] After adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure, antecedent ACEI administration was associated with reduced mortality (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.31-0.98, p=0.0436); a similar, but weaker trend was observed for ARB administration (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.32-1.07, p=0.0796). […] Conclusions In those aged ≥50 years hospitalized with COVID-19, antecedent use of ACEI was independently associated with reduced risk of inpatient death.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) is the receptor for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. […] ACE-2 is a type I transmembrane metallo-carboxypeptidase involved in the Renin-Angiotensin pathway. […] By analyzing two independent databases, ACE-2 was identified in several human tissues including the thyroid. […] Although some cases of COVID-19-related subacute thyroiditis were recently described, direct proof for the expression of the ACE-2 mRNA in thyroid cells is still lacking. […] Aim of the present study was to investigate by RT-PCR whether the mRNA encoding for ACE-2 is present in human thyroid cells. […] The ACE-2 mRNA was detected in all surgical thyroid tissue samples (n = 15). […] Compared with two reporter genes (GAPDH: 0.052 ± 0.0026 Cycles-1; β-actin: 0.044 ± 0.0025 Cycles-1; ACE-2: 0.035 ± 0.0024 Cycles-1), the mean level of transcript expression for ACE-2 mRNA was abundant. […] The expression of ACE-2 mRNA in follicular cells was confirmed by analyzing primary cultures of thyroid cells, which expressed the ACE-2 mRNA at levels similar to tissues.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) is the binding domain for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARSCoV-2.

[…] Varying effects of different classes of antihypertensives on immune and inflammatory markers do not suggest antihypertensive use based on their role in ACE2 expression, but instead suggest investigation of the role of antihypertensives in immune function and inflammation might reveal important information that could optimize their use in SARSCoV-2.

Recent studies have reported that similar to SARS-CoV, this strain expresses a spike protein (S) with a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - an enzyme expressed mostly in the endothelium, kidneys, heart, gastrointestinal tract and lungs - to facilitate viral entry and intracellular replication. […] Incidentally, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is integral to physiologic control of both ACE and ACE2 expression, and is an essential system utilized by SARS-CoV-2, albeit with varying schools of thought on how it can affect viral entry. […] We will then discuss the relevance of these interactions on organ-specific ACE2 expression, and provide scientific insights on how this mechanism can potentially affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in the early phases of disease.

The Renin Angiotensin System (RAS) seems to be involved in COVID-19 natural course, since studies suggest the membrane-bound Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) works as SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor. […] This review aims to discuss possible SARS-CoV-2 intracellular signaling pathways, cell entry mechanism and the possible consequences of the interaction with RAS components, including Angiotensin II (Ang II), Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, Angiotensin II receptor type-1 (AT1), and Mas Receptor. […] Data were obtained independently by the two authors who carried out a search in the PubMed, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane, Scopus, SciELO and the National Institute of Health databases using Medical Subject Heading terms as “SARS-CoV-2,” “COVID-19,” “Renin Angiotensin System,” “ACE2,” “Angiotensin II,” “Angiotensin-(1-7),” and “AT1 receptor.” […] Similarly to other members of Coronaviridae family, the molecular interactions between the pathogen and the membrane-bound ACE2 are based on the cleavage of the spike glycoprotein (S) in two subunits. […] Following the binding of the S1 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to ACE2, transmembrane protease/serine subfamily 2 (TMPRSS2) cleaves the S2 domain to facilitate membrane fusion. […] It is very likely that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry results in downregulation of membrane-bound ACE2, an enzyme that converts Ang II into Ang-(1-7).

[…] Subsequent studies demonstrated the precise localization of ACE2 within the kidney and the importance of this enzyme in the metabolism of Angiotensin II and the formation of Angiotensin 1-7. […] With the recognition early in 2020 of ACE2 being the main receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the interest in this protein has dramatically increased. […] In this review, we will focus on kidney ACE2; its localization, its alterations in hypertension, diabetes, the effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) on ACE2 and the potential use of ACE2 recombinant proteins therapeutically for kidney disease. […] The possibility that binding of SARS-CoV-2 to kidney ACE2 plays a role in the kidney manifestations is also briefly discussed.

ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with extracellular carboxypeptidase activity displaying a broad tissue distribution with highest expression levels at the brush border membrane (BBM) of small intestine enterocytes and a lower expression in stomach and colon. […] In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). […] There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. […] The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. […] Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. […] Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.

[…] Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an intense effort has been made to elucidate the biochemical determinants of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 interaction.

[…] The consequence is that the protective renin-angiotensin system (RAS), of which ACE2 is an essential component, is compromised through lack of production of the protective peptides angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-9), and therefore decreased stimulation of Mas (receptor Mas) and angiotensin AT2-receptors (AT2Rs), while angiotensin AT1-receptors (AT1Rs) are overstimulated due to less degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE2.

[…] Using the network medicine approach and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction networks that could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, lungs and nervous system. […] We compared them with changes in ACE-2 networks following SARS-CoV-2 infection by analyzing public data of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). […] We also performed miRNA-target predictions to identify which miRNAs regulate ACE2-related networks and could play a role in the COVID19 outcome. […] We found similar ACE2 expression confidence levels in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, supporting that heart tissue is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. […] Analysis of ACE2 interaction networks in infected hiPSC-CMs identified multiple hub genes with corrupted signaling which can be responsible for cardiovascular symptoms. […] Enrichment analysis revealed multiple diseases associated with the interaction networks of ACE2, especially cancerous diseases, obesity, hypertensive disease, Alzheimer’s disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure.

[…] Users of ACE-I/ARB had a marginally increased rate of a positive PCR when compared with CCB users (aOR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37), but not when compared with non-users (aOR 1.00 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09). […] Among PCR-positive individuals, 1466 (11%) were ACE-I/ARB users. […] The weighted risk of hospitalisation was 36.5% in ACE-I/ARB users and 43.3% in CCB users (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.02). […] The risk of ICU admission was 6.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 5.4% in CCB users (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.64 to 2.16), while the 30-day mortality was 12.3% in ACE-I/ARB users and 13.9% in CCB users (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.30). […] The associations were similar when ACE-I/ARB users were compared with non-users. […] ACE-I/ARB use was associated neither with a consistently increased rate nor with adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Our findings support the current recommendation of continuing use of ACE-Is/ARBs during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

The key link between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and COVID-19 is ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which acts as a double-edged sword, because ACE2 increases the tissue anti-inflammatory response but it is also the entry receptor for the virus. […] There is an important controversy on several drugs that regulate RAS activity and possibly ACE2, and are widely used, particularly by patients most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. […] In the lung of healthy rats, we observed that candesartan (an angiotensin type-1, AT1, receptor blocker; ARB) and captopril (an ACE inhibitor; ACEI) up-regulated expression of tissue ACE2 and RAS anti-inflammatory axis receptors (AT2 and Mas receptors). […] Treatment of cultures of human type-II pneumocytes with candesartan or captopril induced up-regulation of ACE2 expression in cells. […] Treatment with viral spike protein induced a decrease in full-length (i.e. transmembrane) ACE2, an increase in levels of a short intracellular ACE2 polypeptide and an increase in ADAM17 activity in cells, together with an increase in levels of soluble ACE2 and major proinflammatory cytokines in the culture medium. […] The results suggest that these drugs increase ACE2 levels and promote the anti-inflammatory RAS axis in the lung.

In a more preliminary analysis, the metabolism of the frontal cluster which included the olfactory gyrus was worse in the 7 patients treated by ACE drugs for high blood pressure (p = 0.032), and better in the 3 patients that had used nasal decongestant spray at the infectious stage (p &lt; 0.001). […] The hypometabolism of the frontal cluster, which included the olfactory gyrus, seems to be linked to ACE drugs in patients with high blood pressure, with also a better metabolism of this olfactory region in patients using nasal decongestant spray, suggesting a possible role of ACE receptors as an olfactory gateway for this neurotropism.

The association of ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) with disease severity of patients with COVID-19 is still unclear.

ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are standard-of-care treatments for hypertension and diabetes, common comorbidities among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. […] Their use in the setting of COVID-19 has been heavily debated due to potential interactions with ACE2, an enzyme that links the pro- and anti-inflammatory arms of the in the renin angiotensin system, but also the entryway by which SARS-CoV-2 invades cells. […] ACE2 expression is altered by age, hypertension, diabetes, and the virus itself. […] This study integrated available information about the RAAS system and effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its comorbidities on ACE2 into a mechanistic mathematical model and aimed to quantitatively predict effects of ACEi/ARBs on the RAAS pro-/anti-inflammatory balance. […] RAAS blockade prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection is predicted to increase the mas/AT1 receptor occupancy ratio up to 20-fold, indicating that in patients already taking an ACEi/ARB before infection, the anti-inflammatory arm is already elevated while the pro-inflammatory arm is suppressed. […] Predicted pro-inflammatory shifts in the mas-AT1 ratio due to ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV-2 were small relative to anti-inflammatory shifts induced by ACEi/ARB. […] Predicted effects of changes in ACE2 expression with comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or aging on mas-AT1 occupancy ratio were also relatively small. […] Lastly, predicted changes in the Ang(1-7) production rate with ACEi/ARB therapy, comorbidities, or infection were all small relative to exogenous Ang(1-7) infusion rates shown experimentally to protect against acute lung injury, suggesting that any changes in the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-mas arm may not be large enough to play a major role in COVID-19 pathophysiology.

The two axes of the renin-angiotensin system include the classical ACE/Ang II/AT1 axis and the counter-regulatory ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis. […] ACE2 is a multifunctional monocarboxypeptidase responsible for generating Ang-(1-7) from Ang II. […] ACE2 is important in the vascular system where it is found in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in many vascular beds. […] Among the best characterized functions of ACE2 is its role in regulating vascular tone. […] ACE2 through its effector peptide Ang-(1-7) and receptor Mas1 induces vasodilation and attenuates Ang II-induced vasoconstriction. […] In endothelial cells activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1 axis increases production of the vasodilator’s nitric oxide and prostacyclin’s and in vascular smooth muscle cells it inhibits pro-contractile and pro-inflammatory signaling. […] Endothelial ACE2 is cleaved by proteases, shed into the circulation and measured as soluble ACE2. […] Plasma ACE2 activity is increased in cardiovascular disease and may have prognostic significance in disease severity. […] In addition to its enzymatic function, ACE2 is the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV) and SARS-Cov-2, which cause SARS and coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) respectively. […] ACE-2 is thus a double-edged sword: it promotes cardiovascular health while also facilitating the devastations caused by coronaviruses. […] Mechanisms linking COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are unclear, but vascular ACE2 may be important. […] This review focuses on the vascular biology and (patho)physiology of ACE2 in cardiovascular health and disease and briefly discusses the role of vascular ACE2 as a potential mediator of vascular injury in COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an initial mediator for viral attachment and host cell invasion. […] ACE2 is widely distributed in the human tissues including the cell surface of lung cells which represent the primary site of the infection. […] Inhibiting or reducing cell surface availability of ACE2 represents a promising therapy for tackling COVID-19. […] In this context, most ACE2-based therapeutic strategies have aimed to tackle the virus through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or neutralizing the virus by exogenous administration of ACE2, which does not directly aim to reduce its membrane availability. […] However, through this review, we present a different perspective focusing on the subcellular localization and trafficking of ACE2. […] Membrane targeting of ACE2, and shedding and cellular trafficking pathways including the internalization are not well elucidated in literature. […] Therefore, we hereby present an overview of the fate of newly synthesized ACE2, its post translational modifications, and what is known of its trafficking pathways. […] In addition, we highlight the possibility that some of the identified ACE2 missense variants might affect its trafficking efficiency and localization and hence may explain some of the observed variable severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. […] Moreover, an extensive understanding of these processes is necessarily required to evaluate the potential use of ACE2 as a credible therapeutic target.
