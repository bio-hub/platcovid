One dose of 200 mL of convalescent plasma (CP) derived from recently recovered donors with the neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients as an addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. […] The primary endpoint was the safety of CP transfusion. […] The second endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and laboratory parameters within 3 d after CP transfusion. […] The median time from onset of illness to CP transfusion was 16.5 d. […] After CP transfusion, the level of neutralizing antibody increased rapidly up to 1:640 in five cases, while that of the other four cases maintained at a high level (1:640). […] This study showed CP therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases. […] The optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of CP therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.

It is essential that the clinical pharmacology (CP) characteristics of AZ be considered in planning and conducting clinical trials of AZ alone or in combination with other agents, to ensure safe study conduct and to increase the probability of achieving definitive answers regarding efficacy of AZ in the treatment of COVID-19.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus antibody levels in convalescent plasma (CP), which may be useful in severe Anti-SARS-CoV-2 virus infections, have been rarely reported. […] The patient treated with CP did not require mechanical ventilation 11 days after plasma transfusion, and was then transferred to a general ward. […] Our serological findings in convalescent plasma from recovered patients may help facilitate understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and establish CP donor screening protocol in COVID-19 outbreak.

Convalescent plasma (CP) constitutes the first option in the current situation, since it has been successfully used in other coronaviruses outbreaks. […] Herein, we discuss the possible mechanisms of action of CP and their repercussion in COVID-19 pathogenesis, including direct neutralization of the virus, control of an overactive immune system (i.e., cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, complement activation) and immunomodulation of a hypercoagulable state. […] All these benefits of CP are expected to be better achieved if used in non-critically hospitalized patients, in the hope of reducing morbidity and mortality.

Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. […] COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP)-specific donor screening and selection were performed based the following criteria: 1) aged 18-55 years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID-19; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 h apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks; and 6) had no COVID-19 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. […] In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5 Celsius, and 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. […] CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. […] In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors’ plasma was also tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and S-RBD-specific IgG antibody. […] Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. […] The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1 days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7 days. […] The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 ml. […] In addition, all of the CCP donors’ plasma units were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. […] Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S-RBD-specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of ≥1:320. […] Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. […] In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of ≥ 1:160 for S-RBD-specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.

Convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion was reported to be effective in treating critically ill patients with COVID-19, and hydroxychloroquine could potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. […] Herein, we reported a case receiving combination therapy with CP transfusion and hydroxychloroquine for the first time. […] CP was intravenously given twice, and hydroxychloroquine was orally administrated for a week (0.2 g, three times a day). […] The lactic acid and C-reactive protein levels remained high (2.1 mmol/L and 73.23 mg/L, respectively), while the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation decreased to 86% with a low oxygenation index (OI, 76 mmHg) on day 4 after CP transfusion. […] These findings suggested that the effectiveness of combination therapy with CP and hydroxychloroquine may be non-optimal, and specific therapy needs to be explored.

Biologically, two challenges need to be surmounted to allow convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion to rescue the most severe COVID-19 patients. […] Second, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problems should be considered in the selection of the most suitable CP and the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19. […] This paper presents a rescue framework for the transfusion of the best CP to the most critical patients with COVID-19 on the basis of biological requirements by using machine learning and novel MCDM methods. […] In testing, ABO compatibility is assessed after classifying donors into the four blood types, namely, A, B, AB and O, to indicate the suitability and safety of plasma for administration in order to refine the CP tested list repository. […] Then, the patients with the most urgent need are classified into the four blood types and matched with a tested CP list from the test phase in the donor side. […] Thereafter, the prioritisation of CP tested list is performed using the contracted CP decision matrix. […] An intelligence-integrated concept is proposed to identify the most appropriate CP for corresponding prioritised patients with COVID-19 to help doctors hasten treatments.

[…] It was aimed to report the results of our patients who underwent CP in the treatment of Covid-19. […] CP treatment was applied to 26 Covid-19 patients in intensive care unit who had quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction positive Sars-Cov-2 infection. […] The collected CP (200cc) were applied to severe Covid-19 patients. […] Laboratory values of patients just before CP and after 7 days were compared. […] There were no statistically significant differences in leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, CRP, ferritin, LDH, ALT, AST, sO2 and total bilirubin values just before and after 1 week of CP. […] CP therapy has the potential to provide immediate and promising treatment options before specific vaccines and treatments are developed.

Convalescent plasma (CP) has been used successfully to treat many types of infectious disease, and has shown initial effects in the treatment of the emerging 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). […] To explore the effectiveness of treatment and predict the potential effects of CP with COVID-19, studies of different types of infectious disease treated with CP were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. […] The data quality was assessed, and the data were extracted and pooled for analysis. 40 studies on CP treatment for infectious diseases were included. […] Our study found that CP treatment could reduce the risk of mortality, with a low incidence of adverse events, promote the production of antibodies, lead to a decline in viral load, and shorten the disease course. […] A meta-analysis of 15 controlled studies showed that there was a significantly lower mortality rate in the group treated with CP (pooled OR=0.32; 95% CI=0.19-0.52; p&lt;0.001, I2=54%) compared with the control groups.

[…] Duration in the intensive care unit (ICU), the rate of mechanical ventilation (MV) support and vasopressor support were lower in CP group compared with the control group (p = 0.001, p = 0.02, p = 0.001, respectively). […] The case fatality rate (CFR) was 24.7 % in the CP group, and it was 27.7 % in the control group. […] Administration of CP 20 days after the COVID-19 diagnosis or COVID-19 related symptoms were associated with a higher rate of MV support compared with the first 3 interval groups (≤5 days, 6-10 days, 11-15 days) (p=0.001).

Convalescent plasma (CP) transfusion has been indicated as a promising therapy in the treatment for other emerging viral infections. […] However, the quality control of CP and individual variation in patients in different studies make it rather difficult to evaluate the efficacy and risk of CP therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] We aimed to explore the potential efficacy of CP therapy, and to assess the possible factors associated with its efficacy. […] Each patient was transfused with 200-400 mL of CP from seven recovered donors. […] The primary indicators for clinical efficacy assessment were the changes of clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters, and radiological image after CP transfusion. […] CP donors had a wide range of antibody levels measured by serology tests which were to some degree correlated with the neutralizing antibody (NAb) level. […] No adverse events were observed during and after CP transfusion. […] Following CP transfusion, six out of eight patients showed improved oxygen support status; chest CT indicated varying degrees of absorption of pulmonary lesions in six patients within 8 days; the viral load was decreased to a negative level in five patients who had the previous viremia; other laboratory parameters also tended to improve, including increased lymphocyte counts, decreased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and indicators for liver function. […] The clinical efficacy might be associated with CP transfusion time, transfused dose, and the NAb levels of CP. […] This study indicated that CP might be a potential therapy for severe patients with COVID-19.

The efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP) for the treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear. […] In a matched cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, the impact of CP treatment on in-hospital mortality was evaluated using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, and the impact of CP treatment on time to hospital discharge was assessed using a stratified log-rank analysis. 64 patients who received CP a median of 7 days after symptom onset were compared to a matched control group of 177 patients. […] The incidence of in-hospital mortality was 12.5% and 15.8% in the CP and control groups, respectively (p = 0.52). […] The overall rate of hospital discharge was not significantly different between the two groups (rate ratio [RR] 1.28, 95% CI 0.91 - 1.81), although there was a significantly increased rate of hospital discharge among patients 65-years-old or greater who received CP (RR 1.86, 95% CI 1.03 - 3.36). […] There was a greater than expected frequency of transfusion reactions in the CP group (2.8% reaction rate observed per unit transfused). […] We did not demonstrate a significant difference in risk of mortality or rate of hospital discharge between the CP and control groups.

Convalescent plasma(CP) immunotherapy was an effective method for fighting against similar viral infections such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. […] In the epidemic of COVID-19, a large number of literatures reported the application of CP. […] However, there is controversy over the efficacy of CP therapy for COVID-19. […] This systematic review was designed to evaluate the existing evidence and experience related to CP immunotherapy for COVID-19. […] Second, limited safety data suggested that CP is a well-tolerated therapy with a low incidence of adverse events. […] But, due to lack of safety data for the control group, it is really not easy to determine whether CP transfusion has an impact on moderate to serious AEs. […] Thirdly, for children, pregnant, elderly, tumor and immunocompromised patients, CP may be a well-tolerated therapy, if the disease cannot be controlled and continues to progress. […] Although the results of limited RCTs showed that CP cannot significantly reduce mortality, some non-RCTs and case report(series) have found that CP may help patients improve clinical symptoms, clear the virus, and reduce mortality, especially for patients with COVID-19 within ten days of illness. […] We speculate that CP may be a possible treatment option. […] High-quality studies are needed for establishing stronger quality of evidence and pharmacists should also be actively involved in the CP treatment process and provide close pharmaceutical care.

The efficacy of convalescent plasma (CP), an alternative for the treatment of COVID-19, depends on high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs), but assays for quantifying nAbs are not widely available. […] Our goal was to develop a strategy to predict high titers of nAbs based on the results of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays and the clinical characteristics of CP donors. […] A total of 214 CP donors were enrolled and tested for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG) using two commercial immunoassays: EUROIMMUN (ELISA) and Abbott (Chemiluminescence). […] Regarding the studied criteria for identifying CP donors with high nAbs titers: (a) C1 showed 76.1% accuracy if S/CO = 4.65, (b) C2 presented 76.1% accuracy if S/CO ≥4.57 and (c) C3 had 71.6% accuracy if S/CO was ≥4.57 or if S/CO was between 2.68-4.57 and the last COVID-19-related symptoms were recent (within 19 days).

Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is rapidly becoming an established consideration in the treatment of COVID-19 patients though there is a need to critically review this area for proof of efficacy. […] Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) present in CP generated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection directed against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein are considered to play main role in viral clearance. […] CP infusion may also help in the modulation of immune response by its immunomodulatory effect. […] The FDA allows for administration of CP to COVID-19 patients. […] Though multiple uncertainties exist regarding to its efficacy, appropriate donor selection and NAb titres, the efficacy data of CP use inCOVID-19 is limited having shown hope with early and severe to critically ill COVID-19 patients.
