In addition to taking standard precautions for minimizing COVID-19 risk of exposure for those entering a healthcare facility (screening all personnel upon entry and donning facemasks at all times), we suggest the following three measures: (1) delay post-treatment surveillance visits until there is a decrease in local COVID-19 cases, (2) continue curative intent treatments for localized bladder cancer with COVID-19 precautions (i.e., choosing gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) over dose-dense methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (ddMVAC) neoadjuvant chemotherapy), and (3) increase the off-treatment period between cycles of palliative systemic therapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients.

[…] Since the start of the GC-TS, new themes have been introduced to focus on in the coming years: a) Forcibly displaced persons, b) Global prevalence of stress and trauma related disorders, c) Socio-emotional development across cultures, and d) Collaborating to make traumatic stress research data “FAIR”.

The use of glucocorticoids (GC) is controversial. […] Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of GC in the CSS by COVID-19. […] We included 92 patients with CSS associated to COVID-19 who received GC, GC, and tocilizumab and only tocilizumab. […] In all cases the percentages of events were lower in the group of patients with GC was administered. […] The hazard ratio of the final variables with GC versus the group in which only tocilizumab was administered was lower as CGs were considered, with statistical significance for survival. […] The early use of GC pulses could control SLC, with a lower requirement to use tocilizumab and a decrease in events such as intubation and death.

Using the FRET-based enzymatic assay, several inhibitors including boceprevir, GC-376, and calpain inhibitors II, and XII were identified to have potent activity with single-digit to submicromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values in the enzymatic assay. […] Significantly, four compounds (boceprevir, GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in cell culture with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 0.49 to 3.37 µM. […] A complex crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 M<sup>pro</sup> with GC-376, determined at 2.15 Å resolution with three protomers per asymmetric unit, revealed two unique binding configurations, shedding light on the molecular interactions and protein conformational flexibility underlying substrate and inhibitor binding by M<sup>pro</sup>.

Patients undergoing glucocorticoid (GC) replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency (AI) represent a highly vulnerable group that could develop severe complications due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Once patients with AI present symptoms of COVID-19, the dose of GC replacement therapy should be immediately doubled. […] In the presence of any emergency warning signs or inability to administer oral GC doses, we recommend that patients should immediately seek Emergency services to evaluate COVID-19 symptoms and receive 100 mg hydrocortisone by intravenous injection, followed by 50 mg hydrocortisone intravenously every 6 h or 200 mg/day by continuous intravenous infusion.

We classified patients as those who received only glucocorticoid (GC) pulses, or GC and tocilizumab pulses. […] All patients received GC pulses and in 2 cases simultaneously tocilizumab.

Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) patients in the pandemic era with high hospital burden and under severe oncological/surgical resource constraints should implicate a need for resource re-allocation with a new “pandemic” GC treatment algorithm. […] The neoadjuvant/perioperative (radio-)chemotherapy is applied in the majority of advanced GC cases with poor postoperative therapy compliance.

SARS-CoV-2 translates its own proteins by using the host tRNAs, so that its GC or codon usage should fit that of the host cells. […] The SARS-CoV-2 virus has significantly lower GC content and GC3 as compared to human. […] However, when we selected a set of human genes that have similar GC properties to SARS-CoV-2, we found that these genes were enriched in particular pathways. […] Moreover, these human genes have the codon composition perfectly correlated with the SARS-CoV-2, and were extraordinarily highly expressed in human lung tissues, demonstrating that the SARS-CoV-2 genes have similar GC usage as compared to the lung expressed human genes. […] Our study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 might have adapted to the human lung environment by observing the high correlation between GC usage of SARS-CoV-2 and human lung genes, which suggests the GC content of SARS-CoV-2 is optimized to take advantage of human lung tissues.
