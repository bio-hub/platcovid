Since the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between the SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. […] First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. […] Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV’s capacity for human cell infection. […] Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. […] Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. […] Our decade-long structural studies on the receptor recognition by SARS-CoV have identified key interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV.

According to current observations, 2019-nCoV is weaker than SARS in pathogenesis, but has stronger transmission competence; it’s mechanism of cross-species spread might be related with angiotensin-converting enzyme Ⅱ (ACE2), which is consistent with the receptor SARS-CoV.

The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infected patients by binding human ACE2, leading to severe pneumonia and highly mortality rate in patients. […] ACE2 plays an important role in the RAS, and the imbalance between ACE/Ang II/AT1R pathway and ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway in the RAS system will lead to multi-system inflammation. […] The binding of COVID-19 and ACE2 resulted in the exhaustion of ACE2, and then ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas receptor pathway was inhibited. […] 新型冠状病毒通过与人体血管紧张素转化酶2（ACE2）结合感染产生重症肺炎，传染性强，病死率高，目前无确切有效的治疗方式。 […] ACE2是肾素-血管紧张素系统（RAS）的重要组成部分，RAS系统中ACE/Ang II/AT1R通路与ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas受体通路失衡将导致多系统炎症。 […] 新型冠状病毒与ACE2的结合导致ACE2耗竭，ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas受体通路受到抑制，RAS系统失衡，使新型冠状病毒肺炎患者病死率升高。

The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. […] Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.

ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. […] RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. <i>t</i>-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. […] Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. […] In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. […] Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. […] In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r &gt; 0.2, FDR &lt; 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection. <b>目的：</b> 探索和分析新型冠状病毒感染肺炎（NCP）患者发生肝损伤的可能机制。 […] <b>方法：</b> 综合分析已报道文献中NCP患者的丙氨酸转氨酶（ALT）、天冬氨酸转氨酶（AST）等肝酶变化情况与疾病状态的相关性；基于肝组织单细胞测序数据（GSE115469）分析新冠病毒受体血管紧张素转换酶2（ACE2）在肝组织中的表达；采用RNA-seq方法分析半肝切除急性肝损伤小鼠模型肝切除后不同时间点残肝组织中Ace2的表达及与其表达相关的转录因子。 […] 肝组织单细胞测序和免疫组织化学检测结果显示，ACE2在正常肝组织中只在胆管上皮细胞表达，而在肝细胞中表达极低。 […] 在小鼠半肝切除急性肝损伤模型中，Ace2在术后第1天的急性损伤期表达下调，但在术后第3天的肝细胞增殖高峰期表达升高至正常水平的2倍以上，并在肝脏恢复、肝细胞增殖停止的第7天恢复到正常水平。 […] 这一现象是否提示ACE2表达阳性的胆管上皮细胞参与了部分肝切除后的肝再生过程，值得进一步的研究。 […] RNA-seq数据中有77个转录因子与Ace2表达呈正相关（<i>r</i> &gt; 0.2，FDR &lt; 0.05），主要富集在腺体腔管表皮细胞的发育、分化、形态生成以及细胞增殖等功能。 […] <b>结论：</b> 除了NCP患者过度激活的炎症反应可导致肝损伤外，胆管上皮细胞来源肝实质细胞的代偿性增生所致病毒受体ACE2在肝组织中的表达上调，可能是新型冠状病毒感染肝细胞造成肝组织损伤的可能机制。.

Molecular modeling revealed that 2019-nCoV RBD has a stronger interaction with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] A unique phenylalanine F486 in the flexible loop likely plays a major role because its penetration into a deep hydrophobic pocket in ACE2. […] ACE2 is widely expressed with conserved primary structures throughout the animal kingdom from fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, to mammals. […] Structural analysis suggests that ACE2 from these animals can potentially bind RBD of 2019-nCoV, making them all possible natural hosts for the virus. 2019-nCoV is thought to be transmitted through respiratory droplets. […] However, since ACE2 is predominantly expressed in intestines, testis, and kidney, fecal-oral and other routes of transmission are also possible. […] Finally, antibodies and small molecular inhibitors that can block the interaction of ACE2 with RBD should be developed to combat the virus.

Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) protein is the receptor that facilitates coronavirus entry into cells, the notion has been popularized that treatment with renin-angiotensin system blockers might increase the risk of developing a severe and fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection. […] ACE2 in its full-length form is a membrane-bound enzyme, whereas its shorter (soluble) form circulates in blood at very low levels. […] As a mono-carboxypeptidase, ACE2 contributes to the degradation of several substrates including angiotensins I and II. […] ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors do not inhibit ACE2 because ACE and ACE2 are different enzymes. […] Although angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers have been shown to upregulate ACE2 in experimental animals, the evidence is not always consistent and differs among the diverse angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers and differing organs.

This article reviews the correlation between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and severe risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the possible mechanisms. […] ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] The classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R regulatory axis and the ACE2-Ang 1-7-MasR counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in maintaining homeostasis in humans. […] ACE2 is widely distributed in the heart, kidneys, lungs, and testes. […] ACE2 antagonizes the activation of the classical RAS system and protects against organ damage, protecting against hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. […] Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also uses the ACE2 receptor to invade human alveolar epithelial cells. […] Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical high-mortality disease, and ACE2 has a protective effect on this type of acute lung injury. […] Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on chronic underlying diseases and ARDS, the development of spike protein-based vaccine and drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the future.

To better understand the initial step of infection at an atomic level, we determined the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) bound to the cell receptor ACE2 at 2.45 Å resolution. […] The overall ACE2-binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is nearly identical to that of the SARS-CoV RBD, which also utilizes ACE2 as the cell receptor<sup>4</sup>. […] Structural analysis identified residues in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD that are critical for ACE2 binding, the majority of which either are highly conserved or share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. […] Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly argue for convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses<sup>1-3,5</sup>.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in multiple organs, but its cellular distribution in human heart is not illuminated clearly. […] This study performed the first state-of-art single cell atlas of adult human heart, and revealed that pericytes with high expression of ACE2 might act as the target cardiac cell of SARS-CoV-2. […] And patients with basic heart failure disease showed increased ACE2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, meaning that if infected by the virus these patients may have higher risk of heart attack and critically ill condition.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. […] Recognition that ACE2 is the coreceptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. […] ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades ANG II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7), which antagonizes the effects of ANG II. […] Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins, enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens. […] The current perspective critically examines the evidence for ACE2 regulation by RAAS blockade and statins, the cardiovascular benefits of ACE2, and whether ACE2 blockade is a viable approach to attenuate COVID-19.

[…] This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. […] Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modeling. […] The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively. […] Despite strong overall structural similarities, the spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared with the wild-type molecule. […] Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild-type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), facilitator of amino acid transport, and the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. […] ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. […] ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for COVID-19, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. […] Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. […] The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. […] The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes. […] The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. […] Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated RAS. […] Recombinant human ACE2 has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively. […] Our review summarizes the progress over the past 20 years, highlighting the critical role of ACE2 as the novel SARS-CoV-2 receptor and as the negative regulator of the RAS, together with implications for the COVID-19 pandemic and associated cardiovascular diseases.

[…] In present study, we collected the online available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to evaluate the cell specific expression of ACE2 in maternal-fetal interface as well as in multiple fetal organs. […] Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. […] Meanwhile, ACE2 was also expressed in specific cell types of human fetal heart, liver and lung, but not in kidney. […] And in a study containing series fetal and post-natal mouse lung, we observed ACE2 was dynamically changed over the time, and ACE2 was extremely high in neonatal mice at post-natal day 1~3.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19, infects host cells through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] Pre-clinical models suggest that ACE2 upregulation confers protective effects in acute lung injury. […] Additionally, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors reduce adverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure and chronic kidney disease outcomes, but may increase ACE2 levels.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) maintains the homeostasis of RAS as a negative regulator. […] Recently, ACE2 was identified as the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus that is causing the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] Since SARS-CoV-2 must bind with ACE2 before entering the host cells in humans, the distribution and expression of ACE2 may be critical for the target organ of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Moreover, accumulating evidence has demonstrated the implication of ACE2 in the pathological progression in tissue injury and several chronic diseases, ACE2 may also be essential in the progression and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. […] Therefore, we summarized the expression and activity of ACE2 in various physiological and pathological conditions, and discussed its potential implication in the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the progression and prognosis of COVID-19 patients in the current review.

It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells, in a way similar to that of SARS-CoV. […] Analyzing the distribution and expression level of ACE2 may therefore help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. […] In this study, we utilized previously uploaded information on ACE2 expression in various conditions including SARS-CoA to evaluate the role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV and extrapolate that to COVID-19. […] We found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different. […] However, based on the elevated expression of ACE2 in cigarette smokers, we speculate that long-term smoking may be a risk factor for COVID-19. […] Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication.

SARS-CoV2 host cell infection is mediated by the binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] Systemic dysregulation observed in SARS-CoV was previously postulated to be due to ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis downregulation, increased ACE2 activity was shown to mediate disease protection. […] Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. […] Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.

ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. […] ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. […] The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. […] There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. […] Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. […] In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. […] In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II.

<b>Objective:</b> Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are the key proteins for 2019-nCoV entry into host cells. […] To evaluate the potential infection risk of 2019-nCoV on ocular surface, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among different eye tissues. <b>Methods:</b> Experimental article. […] Real-time PCR was performed to quantify ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression in conjunctiva, cornea, lacrimal gland, iris, lens, retina, lung, heart, kidney, and liver from male mice. […] Published transcriptome datasets were extracted to generate the expression comparasion of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between human conjunctival and corneal tissues, and results were analyzed with Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test. […] Female mice, aging mice, STZ-induced diabetic mice, diabetic group control mice were also subjected to ACE2 expression analysis. […] Results were analyzed using Student’s <i>t</i>-test. <b>Results:</b> The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were the highest in conjunctiva among all the six mice eye tissues explored. […] ACE2 and TMPRSS2 shared similar expression pattern with the staining concentrated in corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium and lacrimal gland serous cells. […] The expression levels of ACE2 showed sex-difference. […] Female mice had lower ACE2 in conjunctiva and cornea than male mice, with the expression levels taking only 43% (<i>t=</i>3.269, <i>P</i>=0.031) and 63% (<i>t=</i>4.080, <i>P</i>=0.015) of that in the male conjunctiva and cornea, respectively. […] Diabetic mice expressed more ACE2 in conjunctiva (1.21-fold, <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) and lacrimal gland (1.10-fold, <i>P</i>&gt;0.05) compared with the control group. […] No significant difference on ACE2 expression was found between the aging and young adult mice. […] The expression level of human conjunctiva ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were significantly higher than that in the cornea (<i>P</i>=0.007), with 5.74-fold and 12.84-fold higher in the conjunctiva than in the corneal epithelium cells, which resembled the situation in mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> The observation of high-level ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in conjunctiva among the 6 eye tissues examined suggests that conjunctiva serves as an infection target tissue of 2019-nCoV. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:)</i>. <b>目的：</b> 分析眼部组织新型冠状病毒侵染和激活关键蛋白人血管紧张素转换酶2（ACE2）和跨膜丝氨酸蛋白酶2（TMPRSS2）的表达情况，探讨新型冠状病毒在眼部的侵染基础。 […] 使用荧光定量PCR分析小鼠结膜、角膜、泪腺、虹膜、晶状体、视网膜ACE2基因和TMPRSS2基因表达情况，并与肺脏、心脏、肾脏、肝脏中两个基因的表达量进行比较。 […] 使用免疫组化染色分析了小鼠各组织中ACE2和TMPRSS2蛋白的分布和表达情况。 […] 另取山东省眼科研究所红十字眼库接收的符合捐献条件的志愿者角膜及结膜组织切片，与小鼠眼部ACE2蛋白和TMPRSS2蛋白表达进行验证比较。 […] 同时通过分析已发表的人眼部组织转录组数据库，比较人角膜和结膜中ACE2和TMPRSS2基因的表达情况。 […] 对不同性别、年龄、及糖尿病条件下小鼠眼表组织的ACE2基因表达变化进行分析，采用独立样本t检验对数据进行统计学分析。 […] <b>结果：</b> 在小鼠6种眼部组织中，结膜ACE2基因和TMPRSS2基因表达量最高，但均低于肾脏和肺脏；ACE2和TMPRSS2蛋白阳性染色集中于结膜上皮、角膜上皮和泪腺腺泡。 […] ACE2基因的表达具有性别的区别，在雌性小鼠结膜和角膜的表达显著低于雄性小鼠，分别为雄性相应组织的43% （<i>t=</i>3.269，<i>P</i>=0.031）和63% （<i>t=</i>4.080，<i>P</i>=0.015）；糖尿病小鼠结膜和泪腺中的ACE2基因表达略高于非糖尿病小鼠，分别为1.21倍和1.10倍 （<i>P</i>&gt;0.05）；在年龄上ACE2基因表达的差异无统计学意义。 […] 与小鼠相似，人结膜ACE2和TMPRSS2基因表达量显著高于角膜（<i>P</i>=0.007），分别约为角膜上皮基因表达量的5.74倍和12.84倍。 […] <b>结论：</b> 结膜中ACE2基因和TMPRSS2的表达在6种检测的眼部组织中最高，提示结膜是新型冠状病毒眼部感染的主要靶组织。

We have previously provided the first genetic evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ACE2 protects the lung from injury, providing a molecular explanation for the severe lung failure and death due to SARS-CoV infections. […] ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19. […] However, it is not known whether human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) blocks growth of SARS-CoV-2. […] Here, we show that clinical grade hrsACE2 reduced SARS-CoV-2 recovery from Vero cells by a factor of 1,000-5,000. […] An equivalent mouse rsACE2 had no effect. […] We also show that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect engineered human blood vessel organoids and human kidney organoids, which can be inhibited by hrsACE2. […] These data demonstrate that hrsACE2 can significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptors mediate the entry into the cell of three strains of coronavirus: SARS-CoV, NL63 and SARS-CoV-2. […] ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous and widely expressed in the heart, vessels, gut, lung (particularly in type 2 pneumocytes and macrophages), kidney, testis and brain. […] ACE2 is mostly bound to cell membranes and only scarcely present in the circulation in a soluble form. […] An important salutary function of membrane-bound and soluble ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin<sub>1-7</sub>. […] Consequently, ACE2 receptors limit several detrimental effects resulting from binding of angiotensin II to AT1 receptors, which include vasoconstriction, enhanced inflammation and thrombosis. […] Unfortunately, the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the cells through membrane fusion markedly down-regulates ACE2 receptors, with loss of the catalytic effect of these receptors at the external site of the membrane. […] Clinical reports of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 show that several features associated with infection and severity of the disease (i.e., older age, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) share a variable degree of ACE2 deficiency. […] We suggest that ACE2 down-regulation induced by viral invasion may be especially detrimental in people with baseline ACE2 deficiency associated with the above conditions. […] The additional ACE2 deficiency after viral invasion might amplify the dysregulation between the ‘adverse’ ACE→Angiotensin II→AT1 receptor axis and the ‘protective’ ACE2→Angiotensin<sub>1-7</sub>→Mas receptor axis. […] In this setting, recombinant ACE2, angiotensin<sub>1-7</sub> and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers could be promising therapeutic approaches in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Evidence has been provided that SARSCoV proteins are cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, respectively, and the amino acids 318-510 of the S1 represent the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which binds to ACE2 [10, 11]. […] Quite importantly, in the context of RBD there is the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (amino acids 424- 494), which accounts for complete binding to ACE2 [11]. […] In this respect, the sequence of COVID-19 RBM is similar to that of SARSCoV, thus, implicating that ACE2 may represent the binding receptors for COVID-19. […] Furthermore, gln493 residue of COVID-19 RBM seems to allow interaction with human ACE2, thus, suggesting the ability of this virus to infect human cells. […] According, to Wan and associates structural analysis [14], COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 with a lesser efficiency than human SARS-CoV (2002) but with higher affinity than human SARS-CoV (2003). […] Furthermore, same authors predicted that a single mutation at the 501 position may enhance the COVID-19 RBD binding capacity to human ACE2 and this evolution should be monitored in infected patients [14]. […] From a pathogenic point of view, evidence has been provided that binding of S2 to ACE2 receptor leads to its down-regulation with subsequent lung damage in the course of SARS-CoV infection [17]. […] Down-regulation of ACE2 causes excessive production of angiotensin (ANG) II by the related enzyme ACE with stimulation of ANG type 1a receptor (AT1R) and enhanced lung vascular permeability [18]. […] In particular, same authors have reported that recombinant ACE2 could attenuate severe acute lung injury in mice [18]. […] Moreover, Battle and associates [19] also proposed to use already available recombinant ACE2 for intercepting COVID-19 and attenuating infection. […] In the previous paragraphs, the presence of ACE2 on immune cells has been pointed out and, by analogy to epithelial cells, this receptor may also be down-regulated following viral entry. […] Therefore, in CoV-infected animal models and in infected humans further investigations are required to clarify a possible reduced expression of ACE2 on immune cells. […] There is evidence that ACE2 protects from severe acute lung failure and operates as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [18, 37]. […] ACE2 counterbalances the noxious effects exhibited by ANG II and AT1R via activation of AT2R which arrests cell growth, inflammation and fibrosis [39]. […] In fact, losartan as well as olmesartan, used for treating hypertension in patients, were able to increase ACE2 expression after 28 days treatment of rats with myocardial infarction [41]. […] Taken together, these evidences suggest that CoV-induced down-regulation of ACE2 activates RAS with collateral damage to organs, such as lungs, in the course of SARS-related pneumonia. […] Then, putative therapeutic measures aimed at increasing ACE2 levels on respiratory epithelial cells should be taken into serious consideration. […] In all these experimental models, RES led to an increase of ACE2 with reduction of organ damage, such as liver steatosis and aorta media thickness and decrease of adipose tissue mass, respectively. […] In turn, Sirt1 down-regulates AT1R expression via ACE2 up-regulation [43, 48]. […] The data above discussed strongly suggest, that RES, as an activators of ACE2, should be investigated in animal models of CoV-induced severe pneumonia, also taking into account the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating effects exerted by polyphenols [49]. […] From a pharmacologic point of view, RAS inhibition leads to upregulation of ACE2, thus, attenuating acute respiratory syndrome and myocarditis in COVID-19-infected patients. […] Conversely, increase in ACE2 expression may facilitate the access into the host of COVID-19, thus, aggravating the clinical picture. […] In fact, there are no available data which support that ACE inhibitors or ANG II type I receptor blockers increase COVID-19 infection via its binding to ACE2. […] Finally, Kuster and associates [52] write that there are no data on the strict relationship between ACE2 activity and SARS-CoV2 mortality. […] Moreover, in the SARSCoV2, cells expressing ACE2 were not attacked by the virus, while cells lacking ACE2 were bound by the SARS-CoV2 virus [53]. […] These findings suggest that also in the case of RES effects on COVID-19 infection, the dual role of ACE2 should be taken into serious consideration.

SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via ACE2 that next to its role in RAAS is needed to inactivate des-Arg9 bradykinin, the potent ligand of the B1R. […] Without ACE2 acting as a guardian to inactivate the ligands of B1R, the lung environment is prone for local vascular leakage leading to angioedema. […] The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, enters the lining of the lungs via an enzyme called the ACE2 receptor, which is present on the outer surface of the lungs’ cells. […] The related coronavirus that was responsible for the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s also needs the ACE2 receptor to enter the cells of the lungs. […] In SARS, the levels of ACE2 in the lung decline during the infection. […] Studies with mice have previously revealed that a shortage of ACE2 leads to increased levels of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure. […] However, other mouse studies have shown that ACE2 protects against a build-up of fluid in the lungs caused by a different molecule made by the body. […] It belongs to a family of molecules known as kinins, and ACE2 is known to inactivate certain kinins. […] This led van de Veerdonk et al. to propose that the excess of fluid in the lungs seen in COVID-19 patients may be because kinins are not being neutralized due to the shortage of the ACE2 receptor.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), reported as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is also expressed in human male testes. […] However, the characteristics of ACE2-positive cells and the expression of other SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes are still worthy of further investigation. […] We found that ACE2 expressing cells existed in almost all testis cell types and Sertoli cells had highest expression level and positive cells ratio. […] Moreover, ACE2 was also expressed in human male PGCs. […] In adulthood, the level of ACE2 expression decreased with the increase of age. […] We also found that ACE2 positive cells had high expressions of stress response and immune activation-related genes. […] Furthermore, ACE2 expression level in NOA donors’ Sertoli cells was significantly decreased.

The objective of this present study is to focus on the <i>in silico</i> study to screen for an alternative drug that can block the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, potential therapeutic target of the COVID-19 virus using natural compounds (Isothymol, Thymol, Limonene, P-cymene and γ-terpinene) derived from the essential oil of the antiviral and antimicrobial plant <i>Ammoides verticillata</i> (Desf.) […] This study reveals that Isothymol, a major component of this plant, gives the best docking scores, compared to, the co-crystallized inhibitor β-D-mannose of the enzyme ACE2, to Captropil drug as good ACE2 inhibitor and to Chloroquine antiviral drug also involved in other mechanisms as inhibition of ACE2 cellular receptor. <i>In silico</i> (ADME), drug-likeness, PASS &amp; P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore Mapper showed that the compound Isothymol has given a good tests results compared to the β-D-mannose co-crystallized inhibitor, to Captopril and Chloroquine drugs. […] The Molecular Dynamics Simulation study showed good result for the Isotymol- ACE2 docked complex. […] This study revealed for the first time that Isothymol is a functional inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity and the components of essential oils <i>Ammoides verticillata</i> can be used as potential inhibitors to the ACE2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2.

Since the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. […] ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. […] ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. […] Although ARBs have been shown to up-regulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. […] Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS-COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. […] Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection.

In this review, we provide the latest insights into the roles of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) and Ang II receptor-1 (AT1-R) in this disease. […] Novel therapeutic strategies, including recombinant ACE2, ACE inhibitors, AT1-R blockers, and Ang 1-7 peptides, may prevent or reduce viruses-induced pulmonary, cardiac, and renal injuries. […] In addition to antiviral therapy, potential ACE2- and AT1-R-inhibiting strategies, and other supportive care, we suggest other potential JAKinibs and novel anti-inflammatory combination therapies that affect the JAK-STAT pathway in patients with COVID-19.

[…] Of note, Pigs and dogs, which are not or not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) has been established as the functional host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the current devastating worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. […] In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. […] Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. […] Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. […] Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. […] In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity.

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9], the causative agent of COVID-19, has been described to interfere with the RAS [2] by interacting -via its spike (S) glycoprotein- with the metallopeptidase Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [9, 10] that is expressed at the surface of epithelial cells from blood vessels, lung, kidney (renal tubules), intestine, and heart, as well as on cerebral neurons and immune monocytes/macrophages [11-13]. […] The latter is cleaved by the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) to produce Angiotensin II (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPF), which is the substrate of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and key player of the RAS. […] When cleaved by ACE2, Angiotensin II gives Angiotensin 1-7 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHP), targeting the vasodilatator proto-oncogene Mas receptor (MasR). […] Angiotensin II can produce Angiotensin A (i.e. peptide ARVYIHPF) via an aspartate decarboxylase, and Alamandine via an additional ACE2 cleavage. […] ACE2 can also cleave Angiotensin I to form Angiotensin 1-9 (i.e. peptide DRVYIHPFH), which targets AT2R. […] Interestingly, it appears that a ‘counter-regulatory’ RAS does exist to modulate system homeostasis; it relies on Angiotensin 1-7, Angiotensin 1-9, Alamandine, Angiotensin A, and Angiotensin IV, which are targeting the MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R vasodilatator receptors, respectively. […] It appears that COVID-19 disorders of SARS-CoV-2-infected humans depend on the RAS over-reacted by the (ACE2-dependent) viral infection and vitamin D deficiency. […] Recombinant ACE2 (under clinical trials) is also considered as a decoy for the recognition and competitive binding to the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 10]. […] The targeted receptors would thus be MasR, AT2R, MRGD, ACE2 and AT4R.

[…] Secondly, the higher <i>ACE2</i> expression rate in females, though controversial, might ascribe them the worst prognosis, in contrast with worldwide epidemiological data.

[…] Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. […] In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. […] Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) is expressed in epithelial cells of many tissues including the kidney, and has been identified to interact with human pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. […] Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. […] We hypothesize that low sodium status makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys.

Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection. […] However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only by angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed. […] This means that preventing uptake of ACE2 into the cell by blocking AT1R would be a more logical approach to limit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell. […] Since ACE2 plays an important protective role in maintaining key biological processes, treatments should not disrupt the functional capacity of ACE2, to counterbalance the negative effects of the infection.

Genetic confirmation of the hypotheses regarding gene expression and mutation pattern of target genes, including angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), basigin (CD147/BSG) and paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme (FURIN/PCSK3), as well as correlation analysis, was done in relation to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) using in silico analysis. […] Not only were gene expression and mutation patterns detected, but also there were correlation and survival analysis between ACE2 and other target genes expression levels. […] The total genetic anomaly carrying rate of target genes, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147/BSG, and FURIN/PCSK3, was determined as 8.1% and 21 mutations were detected, with 7 of these mutations having pathogenic features. p.H34N on the RBD binding residues for SARS-CoV-2 was determined in our LUAD patient group. […] According to gene expression analysis results, though the TMPRSS2 level was statistically significantly decreased in the LUSC patient group compared to healthy control, the ACE2 level was determined to be high in LUAD and LUSC groups.

The spike glycoprotein on the virion surface docking onto the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 dimer is an essential step in the process of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in human cells-involves downregulation of ACE2 expression with systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) imbalance and promotion of multi-organ damage. […] In general, the RAS induces vasoconstriction, hypertension, inflammation, fibrosis, and proliferation via the ACE/Ang II/Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and induces the opposite effects via the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis. […] SARS-CoV-2 induces the ACE2 internalization and shedding, leading to the inactivation of the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis. […] In brief, the first hit originates from chronic inflammation activating the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, and the second originates from the COVID-19 infection inactivating the ACE2/Ang (1-7)/Mas axis.

[…] Once bound to its receptor ACE2, the other two proteases, in concert with the receptor-mediated signaling, allow virus replication and spread throughout the body. […] Our attention has been focused on the role of ACE2 in that its blockade by the virus increases Bradykinin and its metabolites, well known to facilitate inflammation in the lung (responsible for cough and fever), facilitate both the coagulation and complement system, three mechanisms that are typical of angioedema, cardiovascular dysfunction and sepsis, pathologies which symptoms occur in COVID-19 patients.

The spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 may use the same host cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for entering into host cells. […] The affinity between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much higher than that of ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV S protein, explaining why SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more readily transmitted from the human to human. […] Here, we report that ACE2 can be significantly upregulated after infection of various viruses, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, or by the stimulation with inflammatory cytokines such as interferons. […] We propose that SARS-CoV-2 may positively induce its cellular entry receptor, ACE2, to accelerate its replication and spread; high inflammatory cytokine levels increase ACE2 expression and act as high-risk factors for developing COVID-19, and the infection of other viruses may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[…] It is suggested that H<sub>2</sub>S may block SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells by interfering with ACE2 and TMPRSS2, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by attenuating virus assembly/release, and protect SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage by suppressing immune response and inflammation development.

The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current pandemic of COVID-19, which uses the human membrane protein ACE2 as a gateway to host-cell infection. […] We performed a comparative genomic analysis of 70 ACE2 placental mammal orthologues to identify variations and contribute to the understanding of evolutionary dynamics behind this successful adaptation to infect humans. […] Our results reveal that 4% of the ACE2 sites are under positive selection, all located in the catalytic domain, suggesting possibly taxon-specific adaptations related to the ACE2 function, such as cardiovascular physiology. […] Considering all variable sites, we selected 30 of them located at the critical ACE2 binding sites to the SARS-CoV-like viruses for analysis in more detail. […] Our results reveal a relatively high diversity of ACE2 between placental mammal species, while showing no polymorphism within human populations, at least considering the 30 inter-species variable sites.

Like SARS-CoV, ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 is essential for virus to entry to the cell. […] ACE2 is a part of RAS which is expressed in several organs that opposes the AngII functions by converting Ang II to Ang (1-7), the one with vasodilation effects. […] In addition, cardiovascular involvement by SARS-CoV2 could be direct through either ACE2 receptors which are expressed tremendously in heart, or by the surge of different cytokines or by ARDS-induced hypoxia.

This article reviews the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19 and the resulting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). […] ACE2 is a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] The classical ACE-angiotensin Ⅱ (Ang II)-angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis and the ACE2-Ang(1-7)-Mas counter-regulatory axis play an essential role in RAS system. […] ACE2 antagonises the activation of the classical RAS ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis and protects against lung injury. […] Similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also uses ACE2 for cell entry. […] ARDS is a clinical high-mortality disease which is probably due to the excessive activation of RAS caused by 2019-nCoV infection, and ACE2 has a protective effect on ARDS caused by COVID-19. […] Because of these protective effects of ACE2 on ARDS, the development of drugs enhancing ACE2 activity may become one of the most promising approaches for the treatment of COVID-19 in the near future.

Though its pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been recently identified as a receptor for the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into the cell. […] Here, we aimed to clarify the potential role of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2-induced acute lung injury and its underlying mechanism. […] As a receptor for coronavirus, ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells in a similar way as for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). […] The high binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 correlates with its efficient spread among humans. […] On the other hand, ACE2 negatively regulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) primarily by converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, which exerts a beneficial effect on coronavirus-induced acute lung injury. […] Human recombinant ACE2 has been considered as a potential therapy for SARS-CoV-2 by blocking virus entry and redressing the imbalance of RAAS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] The level of ACE2 expression can be upregulated by treatment with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin Ⅱ type 1 receptor blocker (ARB).

The viral entry and thus infectivity is based on the formation of the complex of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] The detection of putative allosteric sites on the viral spike protein can trace the path to develop allosteric drugs to weaken spike-ACE2 interaction and, thus, to reduce the viral infectivity. […] In this work we present results of the application of the Protein Contact Network (PCN) paradigm together with SEPAS (affinity by flexibility) and Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS) based on Elastic Network modes to the complex SARS-CoV spike - ACE2 relative to both 2003 SARS and the recent SARS-CoV-2. […] All the adopted analysis paradigms converge toward a specific region, present in both structures, that is predicted to act as allosteric site modulating the binding of the spike protein with ACE2.

These very legitimate questions are directly the consequence of the recent recognition of the fundamental role of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in COVID-19 infection. […] Indeed, SARS COV2 utilizes ACE2 as a membrane receptor to enter target cells. […] As a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase), ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters its effects. […] Due to a different structure compared with ACE1, ACE2 is insensitive to ACEIs. […] In vitro, both ARBs and ACEi appear able to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression and activity but these results were not confirmed in Humans. […] Due to the crucial role of ACE2, some groups support the hypothesis that a modulation of ACE2 expression could represent a valuable therapeutic target could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. […] So, studies are currently ongoing to test the impact of elevated ACE2 membrane expression, administration of ARB and infusion of soluble ACE2.

[…] Here by analyzing GTEx and other public data in 30 tissues across thousands of individuals, we found a significantly higher level in Asian females, an age-dependent decrease in all ethnic groups, and a highly significant decrease in type II diabetic patients of ACE2 expression. […] Consistently, the most significant expression quantitative loci (eQTLs) contributing to high ACE2 expression are close to 100% in East Asians, &gt;30% higher than other ethnic groups. […] A shockingly common enrichment of viral infection pathways was found among ACE2 anti-expressed genes, and multiple binding sites of virus infection related transcription factors and sex hormone receptors locate at ACE2 regulatory regions. […] Human and mice data analysis further revealed ACE2 expression is reduced in T2D patients and with inflammatory cytokine treatment and upregulated by estrogen and androgen (both decrease with age).

To further investigate this sex difference, we examined the role of ACE2 in Ang-[1-8] (angiotensin [1-8])-induced hypertension and regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney of WT (wild type) and Ace2 KO (knockout) mice. […] This sex difference was attenuated in ACE2 KO mice. […] Ang-[1-8] infusion reduced glomerular AT1R (angiotensin type 1 receptor) binding in WT female mice by 30%, and deletion of <i>Ace2</i> abolished this effect. […] In contrast, Ang-[1-8] infusion increased glomerular AT1R binding in WT male mice by 1.2-fold, and this effect of Ang-[1-8] persisted in Ace2 KO male mice (1.3-fold). […] ACE2 also had an effect on renal protein expression of the neutral endopeptidase NEP (neprilysin), the enzyme that catabolizes Ang-[1-10] (angiotensin [1-10]), the precursor of Ang-[1-8]. […] Deletion of Ace2 resulted in lowered NEP expression after Ang-[1-8] infusion in both sexes. […] These findings suggest sex-specific ACE2 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system contributes to female protection from Ang-[1-8]-induced hypertension.

[…] Any disorder in neprilysin, ACE2, and CAs can lead to increase of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in blood and respiratory acidosis, induction of pulmonary edema and heart and renal failures.

[…] Our results show that ACE2 is widely expressed in human organs that may explain the pulmonary, systemic, and neurological deficits seen in COVID-19 patients.

Both ACE2 (an entry receptor) and TMPRSS2 (used by the virus for spike protein priming) are key proteins to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, enabling progression to COVID-19 in humans. […] Comparative genomic research into critical ACE2 binding sites, associated with the spike receptor binding domain, has suggested that African and Asian primates may also be susceptible to disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] To characterize potential functional variation in savanna monkey ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we inspected recently published genomic data from 245 savanna monkeys, including 163 wild monkeys from Africa and the Caribbean and 82 captive monkeys from the Vervet Research Colony (VRC). […] One missense variant in ACE2 (X:14,077,550; Asp30Gly), common in Ch. sabaeus, causes a change in amino acid residue that has been inferred to reduce binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting potentially reduced susceptibility. […] All missense variants observed in wild Ch. sabaeus populations are also present in the VRC, along with two splice acceptor variants (at X:14,065,076) not observed in the wild sample that are potentially disruptive to ACE2 function.

It has been now clearly established that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, infects the host cell through biding and being internalized with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a surface protein expressed in a noticeable number of human cells, especially in those of upper and lower respiratory tracts, heart, kidney, testis, adipose tissue, gastrointestinal system and in lymphocytes. […] Accumulating evidence now suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene may modulate intermolecular interactions with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and/or contribute to pulmonary and systemic injury by fostering vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidation and fibrosis. […] We hence argue that the development of genetic tests aimed at specifically identifying specific COVID-19-susceptible or -protective ACE2 variants in the general population may be a reasonable strategy for stratifying the risk of infection and/or unfavorable disease progression.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) directly binds to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) to facilitate cellular entry. […] Compared with the lung or respiratory tract, the human heart exhibits greater ACE2 expression. […] This study aims to analyse ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein proteases at the single-cell level, to explore the cardiac involvement in COVID-19 and improve our understanding of the potential cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. […] With public single-cell sequence data analysis, ACE2 expression in the adult human heart is higher than that in the lung (adjusted P &lt; 0.0001). […] Compared with the lung, ACE2 is relatively more highly expressed in the human heart, while the key S protein priming protease, TMPRSS2, is rarely expressed. […] The low percentage of ACE2+/TMPRSS2+ cells reduced heart vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 to some degree.

[…] Strikingly, ACE2 was up-regulated in cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, oesophageal carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma compared to controls. […] Furthermore, the patients with common chronic diseases regarding angiocardiopathy, type 2 diabetes, liver, pneumonia and hypertension were also with higher ACE2 expression compared to related controls, which were validated using independent data sets. […] Collectively, our study may reveal a novel important mechanism that the patients with certain cancers and chronic diseases may express higher ACE2 expression compared to the individuals without diseases, which could lead to their higher susceptibility to multi-organ injury of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection of pneumocytes, the hallmark of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) involving both alveolar interstitium and capillaries, is linked to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and its functional downregulation. […] ACE2 is a key enzyme for the balance between the two main arms of the RAS: the ACE/angiotensin (Ang) II/Ang II type 1 receptor axis (“classic RAS”) and the ACE2/Ang(1-7)/Mas receptor (MasR) axis (“anti-RAS”). […] The ACE2 downregulation, as a result of SARS-coronaviruses binding, enhances the classic RAS, leading to lung damage and inflammation with leaky pulmonary blood vessels and fibrosis, when the attenuation mediated by the anti-RAS arm is reduced.

One potential therapeutic target is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] ACE2 primarily catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to a nonapeptide angiotensin or the conversion of angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7) and has direct effects on cardiac function and multiple organs via counter-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] Significant to COVID-19, ACE2 is postulated to serve as a major entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, as it does for SARS-CoV. […] ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lungs at high level, a major target of the disease, as seen in post-mortem lung tissue of patients who died with COVID-19, which reveals diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates bilaterally. […] Comparatively, ACE2 is expressed at low level by vascular endothelial cells of the heart and kidney but may also be targeted by the virus in severe COVID-19 cases. […] Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection downregulates ACE2 expression, which may also play a critical pathogenic role in COVID-19. […] Importantly, targeting ACE2/Ang 1-7 axis and blocking ACE2 interaction with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 to curtail SARS-CoV-2 infection are becoming very attractive therapeutics potential for treatment and prevention of COVID-19.

[…] We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible in the placenta, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. […] An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. […] Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-speciﬁc molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the human receptor that interacts with the spike protein of coronaviruses, including the one that produced the 2020 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). […] Thus, ACE2 is a potential target for drugs that disrupt the interaction of human cells with SARS-CoV-2 to abolish infection. […] There is also interest in drugs that inhibit or activate ACE2, that is, for cardiovascular disorders or colitis. […] Herein, we review biochemical, chemical biology, and structural information on ACE2, including the recent cryoEM structures of full-length ACE2. […] We conclude that ACE2 is very dynamic and that allosteric drugs could be developed to target ACE2. […] At the time of the 2020 pandemic, we suggest that available ACE2 inhibitors or activators in advanced development should be tested for their ability to allosterically displace the interaction between ACE2 and the spike protein.

The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection requires the binding of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, well-known for its role in counteracting ACE. […] ACE2 is involved in modulating blood pressure and establishing blood pressure homeostasis. […] Recently, a critical debatable question has arisen whether using antihypertensive medications will have a favorable impact on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one, mainly because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy can modulate the expression of ACE2 protein. […] The concern is that the use of ACEIs and ARBs will increase the expression of ACE2 and increase patient susceptibility to viral host cell entry and propagation. […] On the other hand, several genetic association studies have examined the relationship between ACE2 genetic variants and the risk of developing hypertension in different ethnic populations. […] In this review, we discuss the ongoing arguments in the literature about ACE2’s role in mortality rate among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients comorbid with hypertension and critically evaluate the current debate about the usage or discontinuation of ACEI/ARB antihypertensive drugs. […] Moreover, we explore the two opposing roles that ACE2 genetic variants might be playing in COVID-19 by reducing ACE2 receptor effectiveness and mitigating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.

[…] Indeed, ACE2 is a membrane and secreted protein, while the expression of ACE2 in blood and common blood cells remains unknown. […] Herein, the proteomic data in HIPED and the antibody-based immunochemistry result in HPA were collected to analyze the distribution of ACE2 protein in human tissues.

[…] Moreover, the abundance of ACE2 in human blood and blood cells was determined by analyzing the data in the PeptideAtlas and the HPA Blood Atlas. […] We found that the mRNA expression cannot reflect the abundance of ACE2 factor due to the strong differences between mRNA and protein quantities of ACE2 within and across tissues. […] Our results suggested that ACE2 protein is mainly expressed in the small intestine, kidney, gallbladder, and testis, while the abundance of which in brain-associated tissues and blood common cells is low. […] HIPED revealed enrichment of ACE2 protein in the placenta and ovary despite a low mRNA level.

[…] ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. […] To determine the expression and in situ localisation of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analysed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, proteomic datasets, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.We demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. […] Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung, confirmed with proteomics. […] We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147 and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 and GRP78 in the respiratory mucosa.Collectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.

Both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-protein), a critical element of the viral entry to the host cell, and ACE2, its docking site on the host cell surface, are extensively glycosylated, making them challenging targets for native MS. […] However, supplementing native MS with a gas-phase ion manipulation technique (limited charge reduction) allows meaningful information to be obtained on the noncovalent complexes formed by ACE2 and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein. […] Using this technique in combination with molecular modeling also allows the role of heparin in destabilizing the ACE2/RBD association to be studied, providing critical information for understanding the molecular mechanism of its interference with the virus docking to the host cell receptor. […] This association alters the protein conformation (to maximize the contiguous patch of the positive charge on the RBD surface), resulting in a notable decrease in its ability to associate with ACE2. […] The destabilizing effect of heparin is more pronounced in the case of the longer chains due to the electrostatic repulsion between the low-pI ACE2 and the heparin segments not accommodated on the RBD surface. […] In addition to providing important mechanistic information on attenuation of the ACE2/RBD association by heparin, the study demonstrates the yet untapped potential of native MS coupled to gas-phase ion chemistry as a means of facilitating rational repurposing of the existing medicines for treating COVID-19.

[…] We detected 349 and 551 SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, in a total of 156 513 individuals. […] These SNVs were distributed throughout the coding regions; some ACE2 variants were located in the SARS-CoV-2/hACE2 contact residues, with a hemizygous state occurring in males. […] Using regression analysis, the total numbers of genetic variations in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were 1.1×103 and 1.5×103, respectively, for a population of one million people. […] The majority of SNVs in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are rare, population-specific and deleterious, and a multitude of very rare SNVs may explain different susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

[…] Here, we identified a series of R. sinicus ACE2 variants with some polymorphic sites involved in the interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein. […] Pseudoviruses or SARSr-CoVs carrying different spike proteins showed different infection efficiencies in cells transiently expressing bat ACE2 variants. […] All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with that of their SARS-CoV counterpart. […] Structure modeling revealed that the difference in binding affinity between spike and ACE2 might be caused by the alteration of some key residues in the interface of these two molecules. […] These results suggest that the SARSr-CoV spike protein and R. sinicus ACE2 may have coevolved over time and experienced selection pressure from each other, triggering the evolutionary arms race dynamics.IMPORTANCE Evolutionary arms race dynamics shape the diversity of viruses and their receptors. […] Here, we show the highly polymorphic ACE2 in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. […] These ACE2 variants support SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoV infection but with different binding affinities to different spike proteins.

[…] Current data shows that spironolactone may concurrently mitigate abnormal ACE2 expression, correct the balances membrane-attached and free circulating ACE2 and between angiotensin II and Angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), suppress androgen-mediated TMPRSS2 activity, and inhibit obesity-related RAAS dysfunctions, with consequent decrease of viral priming.

ACE2 has anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-proliferative characteristics through converting angiotensin (Ag)-II to Ang (1-7). […] ACE2 receptor is downregulated by the SARS-COV through the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S) via a process that is tightly coupled with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production. […] Affected children by COVID-19 with genetically-susceptible to KD might have genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor that might further decrease the expression of ACE2 due to the downregulation of the receptor by the virus in these patients. […] It appears that TNF- α might be the cause and the consequence of the ACE2 receptor downregulation which results in arterial walls aneurysm. […] Conclusion: Genetically under-expression of ACE2 receptor in children with genetically-susceptible to KD who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 possibly further downregulates the ACE2 expression by TNF-α and leads to surge of inflammation including TNF-α and progression to Kawasaki-like disease.

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays an important role in inflammation, which is attributable at least, in part, to the conversion of the pro-inflammatory angiotensin (Ang) II peptide into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), a peptide which opposes the actions of AngII. […] ACE2 and AngII are present in many tissues but information on the cornea is lacking. […] We observed that mice deficient in the Ace2 gene (Ace2-/-), developed a cloudy cornea phenotype as they aged. […] Corneal epithelial debridement experiments in young ACE2-deficient mice showed normal appearing corneas, devoid of haze. […] Since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes human ACE2 as the receptor for entry with subsequent downregulation of ACE2, corneal inflammation in Ace2-/- mice may have a similar mechanism with that in COVID-19 patients. […] Thus the Ace2-/- cornea, because of easy accessibility, may provide an attractive model to explore the molecular mechanisms, immunological changes, and treatment modalities in patients with COVID-19.

Development of novel approaches for regulating the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is becoming increasingly important within the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic since these enzymes play a crucial role in cell infection. […] In this work we searched for putative ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression regulation networks mediated by various miRNA isoforms (isomiR) across different human organs using publicly available paired miRNA/mRNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. […] As a result, we identified several miRNA families targeting ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in multiple tissues. […] In particular, we found that lysine-specific demethylase 5B (JARID1B), encoded by the KDM5B gene, can indirectly affect ACE2 / TMPRSS2 expression by repressing transcription of hsa-let-7e / hsa-mir-125a and hsa-mir-141 / hsa-miR-200 miRNA families which are targeting these genes.

[…] The expression level of hACE2 protein was determined to be high in hearts, kidneys, and brains of dTg mice, whereas lung, liver, and testis tissues expressed low levels. […] The level of hACE2 was significantly enhanced in hearts and kidneys of the Dox+dTg group compared to that in Vehicle+dTg mice although consistent levels of mouse ACE2 (mACE2) remained in the same tissues.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta coronavirus that uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a point of entry. […] The present review discusses the origin and structure of the virus and its mechanism of cell entry followed by the therapeutic potentials of strategies directed towards SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding, the renin-angiotensin system, and the kinin-kallikrein system. […] SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding-directed approaches mainly consist of targeting receptor binding domain, ACE2 blockers, soluble ACE2, and host protease inhibitors. […] In conclusion, blocking or manipulating the SARS-CoV2-ACE2 binding interface perhaps offers the best tactic against the virus that should be treated as a fundamental subject of future research.

Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is upregulated in normal pregnancy. […] Upregulation of ACE2 mediates conversion of angiotensin II (vasoconstrictor) to angiotensin-(1-7) (vasodilator) and contributes to relatively low blood pressures, despite upregulation of other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. […] As a result of higher ACE2 expression, pregnant women may be at elevated risk for complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Upon binding to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 causes its downregulation, thus lowering angiotensin-(1-7) levels, which can mimic/worsen the vasoconstriction, inflammation, and pro-coagulopathic effects that occur in preeclampsia.

[…] Mammals with either type of ACE2 will be deficient in support of SARS-CoV-2 entry.

[…] It is further complicated by organ specific pathology related to loss of ACE2 expressing cells particularly affecting the endothelium, alveolus, glomerulus and cardiac microvasculature. […] The possible upregulation in ACE2 receptor expression may predispose individuals with aberrant RAS status to higher viral load on infection and relatively more cell loss.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel member of the betacoronaviruses family affecting the lower respiratory tract mainly through binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via its S-protein. […] Genetic analysis of (ACE2) gene revealed several variants that have been suggested to regulate the interaction with S protein. […] The effect of N720D variant on ACE2 structure and thermodynamic stability was studied by DynaMut. […] HDOCK was utilised to model TMPRSS2 protease binding to ACE2 WT and D720 variant cleavage site. […] PRODIGY was used to calculate binding affinities and MD simulation tools calculated the at 100 ns for ACE2 apo structure and the ACE2-TMPRSS2 complex. […] The hotspot N720D variant in the CLD of ACE2 affected the stability and flexibility of ACE2 by increasing the level of motion in the loop region, resulting in a more favourable site for TMPRSS2 binding and cleavage. […] Consequently, this would facilitate S-protein binding and can potentially increase viral entry highlighting the importance of variants affecting the ACE2-TMPRSS2 complex.

In this context, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue, has been recognized as a facilitator of viral entry into the host, albeit its involvement in other counter-regulatory effects, such as converting angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang 1-7 with its known protective actions. […] Thus, concern was raised that the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors by increasing ACE2 expression may enhance patient susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus. […] Based on these intricate mechanisms, various preventive and therapeutic strategies may be devised, such as upregulating ACE2 and/or using recombinant ACE2, and exploiting the NEP, bradykinin and serine protease pathways, in addition to anti-inflammatory and antiviral therapies.

It is widely known that SARS-CoV-2 uses membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor, resulting in internalisation of the complex by the host cell. […] We discuss the evidence that failure to suppress coronaviral replication within 5 days results in sustained downregulation of ACE2 protein expression, and that ACE2 is under negative-feedback regulation. […] We then expose openly-available experimental repository data that demonstrate the gene for ACE2 lies in a novel cluster of interegulated genes on the X chromosome including PIR encoding pirin (quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase), and VEGFD encoding the predominantly lung-expressed vascular endothelial growth factor D. […] Thus for patients who fail to rapidly suppress viral replication, the newly-appreciated ACE2 co-regulated cluster predicts delayed responses that would account for catastrophic deteriorations. […] We conclude that ACE2 homeostatic drives provide a unified understanding which should help optimise therapeutic approaches during the wait until safe, effective vaccines and antiviral therapies for SARS-CoV-2 are delivered.

Discovery of ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) revealed that the renin-angiotensin system has 2 counterbalancing arms. […] ACE2 is a major player in the protective arm, highly expressed in lungs and gut with the ability to mitigate cardiopulmonary diseases such as inflammatory lung disease. […] ACE2 also exhibits activities involving gut microbiome, nutrition, and as a chaperone stabilizing the neutral amino acid transporter, B0AT1, in gut. […] But the current interest in ACE2 arises because it is the cell surface receptor for the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2, to infect host cells, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. […] This suggests that ACE2 be considered harmful, however, because of its important other roles, it is paradoxically a potential therapeutic target for cardiopulmonary diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. […] This review describes the discovery of ACE2, its physiological functions, and its place in the renin-angiotensin system. […] It illustrates new analyses of the structure of ACE2 that provides better understanding of its actions particularly in lung and gut, shedding of ACE2 by ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metallopeptidase domain 17 protein), and role of TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine proteases 2) in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 entry into host cells. […] Cardiopulmonary diseases are associated with decreased ACE2 activity and the mitigation by increasing ACE2 activity along with its therapeutic relevance are addressed. […] Finally, the potential use of ACE2 as a treatment target in COVID-19, despite its role to allow viral entry into host cells, is suggested.

We hypothesized that the observed low incidence of perinatal infection could be related to a low expression of the membrane receptor for SARS-CoV2, ACE2, in the fetal-placental unit. […] We evaluated protein expression of ACE2 both in placentas and fetal organs from non-infected pregnancies across gestation. […] Immunocytochemistry analysis for ACE2 in organs and placentas were performed in May 2020, in samples from a registered biobank. […] Tissues’ sections were incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-ACE2. […] Protein expression of ACE2 was detected by immunochemistry. […] ACE2 expression was detected in fetal kidneys, rectum and ileum across gestation and similarly in the pediatric control. […] In the pediatric control, ACE2 was only detectable in type 2 pneumocytes. […] No ACE2 expression was found in the cerebral ependymal, parenchyma nor in cardiac tissues ACE2 was expressed in syncitiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast from 7th weeks’ onwards and across gestation but not in the amnion. […] Similar intensity and distribution of ACE2 staining were identified in the mother’s SARS-CoV2 placenta. […] Marked placental expression of ACE2 provides a rationale for vertical transmission at cellular level. […] Absence of ACE2 expression in the fetal brain and heart is reassuring on the risk of congenital malformation.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plays a crucial role in binding the human cell receptor ACE2 that is required for viral entry. […] Many studies have been conducted to target the structures of RBD-ACE2 binding and to design RBD-targeting vaccines and drugs. […] Nevertheless, mutations distal from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD also impact its transmissibility and antibody can target non-RBD regions, suggesting the incomplete role of the RBD region in the spike protein-ACE2 binding. […] Here, in order to elucidate distant binding mechanisms, we analyze complexes of ACE2 with the wild-type spike protein and with key mutants via large-scale all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations. […] We find that though distributed approximately 10 nm away from the RBD, the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage sites enhance, via electrostatic interactions and hydration, the RBD-ACE2 binding affinity. […] We find that the tetrapeptide GluGluLeuGlu binds to one of the three polybasic cleavage sites of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein lessening by 34% the RBD-ACE2 binding strength. […] This significant binding energy reduction demonstrates the feasibility to neutralize RBD-ACE2 binding by targeting this specific polybasic cleavage site. […] Our work enhances understanding of the binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, which may aid the design of therapeutics for COVID-19 infection.

[…] In all specimens, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed throughout the surface epithelium (corneal, limbal, and conjunctival) and corneal endothelium. […] In corneal stromal cells, ACE2 was sporadically expressed, whereas TMPRSS2 was absent. […] Four specimens expressed DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR in a similar distribution to ACE2, but 1 specimen from a young donor showed no expression of DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR. […] ACE2, TMPRSS2, and DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR were all expressed in the cultured corneal, limbal, and conjunctival epithelial cells. […] Both corneal and conjunctival epithelia express ACE2, DC-SIGN/DC-SIGNR, and TMPRSS2, suggesting that the ocular surface is a potential route for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. […] The risk of viral transmission with corneal transplantation cannot be ruled out, given the presence of ACE2 in corneal epithelium and endothelium.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), through its surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) recognition on the receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in humans. […] However, it remains unclear how genetic variations in ACE2 may affect its function and structure, and consequently alter the recognition by SARS-CoV-2. […] We have systemically characterized missense variants in the gene ACE2 using data from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD; N = 141,456). […] We further analyzed the structural flexibility of ACE2 and its protein-protein interface with the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 using our developed Legion Interfaces Analysis (LiAn) program. […] Here, we characterized a total of 12 ACE2 putative deleterious missense variants. […] Of those 12 variants, we further showed that p.His378Arg could directly weaken the binding of catalytic metal atom to decrease ACE2 activity and p.Ser19Pro could distort the most important helix to the S-protein. […] We provide strong evidence of putative deleterious missense variants in ACE2 that are present in specific populations, which could disrupt the function and structure of ACE2. […] These findings provide novel insight into the genetic variation in ACE2 which may affect the SARS-CoV-2 recognition and infection, and COVID-19 susceptibility and treatment.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a key counter regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), is the main entry gate of SARS-CoV-2 into human host cells and an established drug target to prevent heart failure. […] In fact, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid antagonists may augment ACE2 levels to protect organs from angiotensin II overload. […] Elevated ACE2 expression on the host cell surface might facilitate viral entrance, at the same time sudden nonadherence to these medications triggers MACEs. […] Although ACE2 generally plays an adaptive role in both healthy subjects and patients with systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction, we conducted a literature appraisal on its maladaptive role. […] Understanding the exact role of ACE2 in COVID-19 patients at risk of heart failure is needed to safely manage RAS inhibitors in frail and non-frail critically ill patients.

Entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell involves interaction of the virus (via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of its spike glycoprotein) with the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) followed by the virus-ACE2 complex internalization by the cell. […] Since ACE2 is expressed in various tissues, such as brain, gut, heart, kidney, and lung, and since these organs represent obvious targets for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, therapeutic approaches were developed to either inhibit ACE2 or reduce its expression as a means of prevention of the virus entry into the corresponding host cells. […] The problem here is that in addition to be a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells, ACE2 acts as a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) aimed at the generation of a cascade of vasoactive peptides coordinating several physiological processes.

SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV binds with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on human cells. […] SARS-CoV has been found to downregulate ACE2 and SARS- CoV-2 infection has been found to be associated with increased level of Angiotensin II. […] Based on these facts, we presume that SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV downregulates ACE2, and in absence/reduced activity of ACE2, level of angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9) is decreased while that of angiotensin II is increased and increased level of angiotensin II has been found to correlate with lung injury and viral load. […] We presume that restoration of normal functioning of renin-angiotensin system with recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (rhACE2), angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9) may be an effective therapeutic measure but studies will be required to test this hypothesis and explore its possible role in treatment of COVID-19.

The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, uses the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming. […] Meanwhile, the presence of B0AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. […] The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. […] ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. […] Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. […] Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. […] ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung.

[…] The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of ACE2 in the gastrointestinal tract of domestic (cat) and wild (tiger) felines. […] The tissues were processed for immunofluorescence assay with an anti-human ACE2 antibody. […] In both the species, ACE2-immunoreactivity (ACE2-IR) was expressed by the mucosal epithelial cells of the GIT and by the enteric neurons. […] In the cats, ACE2-IR was also expressed by the smooth muscle cells of the blood vessels and the tunica muscularis. […] The expression of the ACE2 receptor in enteric neurons may support the potential neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2. […] Although the evidence of ACE2-IR in the feline GIT does not necessarily indicate the possibility of viral replication and SARS-CoV-2 spread with stool, the findings in the present study could serve as an anatomical basis for additional studies considering the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission between cats/felids, and between cats/felids and humans.

[…] In addition to showing a broad susceptibility potential across mammalian species based on structural analysis, our results also reveal that domestic animals including dogs, pigs, cattle and goats may evolve ACE2-related immunogenetic diversity to restrict SARS-CoV2 infections.

[…] Using cancer genomics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we performed computational analyses of associations between ACE2 expression and antitumor immunity, immunotherapy response, oncogenic pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical outcomes in 13 cancer cohorts. […] We found that ACE2 upregulation was associated with increased antitumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression, and favorable anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy response. […] ACE2 expression levels inversely correlated with the activity of cell cycle, mismatch repair, TGF-β, Wnt, VEGF, and Notch signaling pathways. […] Moreover, ACE2 expression levels had significant inverse correlations with tumor proliferation, stemness, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. […] ACE2 upregulation was associated with favorable survival in pan-cancer and in multiple individual cancer types.

However, recent studies highlight the potential for IFNs to enhance expression of host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that IFN therapy or natural coinfections could exacerbate COVID-19 by upregulating this critical virus entry receptor. […] Using a cell line model, we found that beta interferon (IFN-β) strongly upregulated expression of canonical antiviral ISGs, as well as ACE2 at the mRNA and cell surface protein levels. […] Strikingly, IFN-λ1 upregulated antiviral ISGs, but ACE2 mRNA was only marginally elevated and did not lead to detectably increased ACE2 protein at the cell surface. […] IFN-γ induced the weakest ISG response but clearly enhanced surface expression of ACE2. […] Our data imply that type-specific mechanisms or kinetics shape IFN-enhanced ACE2 transcript and cell surface levels but that the antiviral action of IFNs against SARS-CoV-2 counterbalances any proviral effects of ACE2 induction. […] Nevertheless, IFNs can have undesirable side effects, and recent reports indicate that IFNs upregulate the expression of host ACE2 (a critical entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2), raising the possibility that IFN treatments could exacerbate COVID-19. […] Here, we studied the antiviral- and ACE2-inducing properties of different IFN types in both a human lung cell line model and primary human bronchial epithelial cells. […] We observed differences between IFNs with respect to their induction of antiviral genes and abilities to enhance the cell surface expression of ACE2. […] Nevertheless, all the IFNs limited SARS-CoV-2 replication, suggesting that their antiviral actions can counterbalance increased ACE2.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by its spike glycoprotein (S-glycoprotein), and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a cellular receptor. […] Here, we use atomic force microscopy to investigate the mechanisms by which the S-glycoprotein binds to the ACE2 receptor. […] We demonstrate, both on model surfaces and on living cells, that the receptor binding domain (RBD) serves as the binding interface within the S-glycoprotein with the ACE2 receptor and extract the kinetic and thermodynamic properties of this binding pocket.

[…] In agreement with an experimental study, we find a high affinity of the hexapeptide to the binding interface between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, which we investigate using 20 independent equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations over a total of 1 μs and a 200-ns enhanced correlation guided MD simulation. […] We then evaluate the effect of the hexapeptide on the assembly process of the CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 in long-time enhanced correlation guided MD simulations. […] In that set of simulations, we find that CoV-2 RBD does not bind to ACE2 with the binding motif shown in experiments, but it rotates because of an electrostatic repulsion and forms a hydrophobic interface with ACE2. […] Surprisingly, we observe that the hexapeptide binds to CoV-2 RBD, which has the effect that this protein only weakly attaches to ACE2 so that the activation of CoV-2 RBD might be inhibited in this case. […] Our results indicate that the hexapeptide might be a possible treatment option that prevents the viral activation through the inhibition of the interaction between ACE2 and CoV-2 RBD.

ACE2 has been identified as a cell entry receptor for the virus.

[…] Therefore, we analyzed the expression of ACE2 in the blood to identify the individuals who may be susceptible to infection. […] Methods: In total, 229 subjects were enrolled in this study, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and ELISA assay was used to identify the level of ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 protein level in the blood. […] Independent Student’s t-test, Pearson’s linear correlation, logistic regression analysis, and multiple linear regression correlation were performed to assess the association between these factors and the expression of ACE2. […] Results: Higher level of ACE2 was observed in females, older subjects, subjects with hypertension, subjects with a cardiocerebrovascular disease, male smokers, and subjects with cancer (p &lt; 0.05) than in other subjects. […] Multiple linear regression analysis showed that there is a statistically significant correlation between being a female and ACE2 expression (β = 0.550, p &lt; 0.001), between older age and ACE2 expression (β = 0.197, p = 0.003), between smoking and ACE2 expression (β = 0.163, p = 0.037), and between cancer and ACE2 expression (β = 0.265, p &lt; 0.001). […] Logistic regression analysis revealed that female subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 2.255, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.770-2.872), subjects with hypertension (OR = 1.264, 95% CI = 1.075-1.486), subjects with a cardiocerebrovascular disease (OR = 1.271, 95% CI = 1.023-1.579), subjects with cancer (OR = 1.695, 95% CI = 1.253-2.293), and subjects above 60 years of age (OR = 3.097, 95% CI = 1.078-8.896) are at an increased risk of infection due to their high expression of ACE2. […] Conclusion: The level of ACE2 is higher in females, older subjects, smokers, and subjects with cancer than in other subjects, indicating that some of which are at higher risk for the severe forms of COVID-19 when they are exposed to the SARS-Cov-2.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as a key cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested to be a limiting factor for viral entry at the initial infection stage.

[…] The expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells is tightly regulated by inflammatory milieu and environmental and internal stimuli. […] Very recently, ACE2 has been reported to have different expression levels in airways under distinct chronic inflammatory airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergic asthma, which may associate with the COVID-19 risk and affect the management of primary airway diseases. […] In this review, we focus on the cutting-edge progress in distribution, expression, and regulation of ACE2 in respiratory system in physiological and pathological conditions, and their implication for the development of COVID-19.

ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. […] Yet, little is known about the clinical and biologic correlates of circulating ACE2 levels in humans. […] We assessed the clinical and proteomic correlates of plasma (soluble) ACE2 protein levels in human heart failure. […] We measured plasma ACE2 using a modified aptamer assay among PHFS (Penn Heart Failure Study) participants (n=2248). […] We performed an association study of ACE2 against ≈5000 other plasma proteins measured with the SomaScan platform. […] Plasma ACE2 was not associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker use. […] Plasma ACE2 was associated with older age, male sex, diabetes mellitus, a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, worse New York Heart Association class, a history of coronary artery bypass surgery, and higher pro-BNP (pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels. […] Plasma ACE2 exhibited associations with 1011 other plasma proteins. […] In pathway overrepresentation analyses, top canonical pathways associated with plasma ACE2 included clathrin-mediated endocytosis signaling, actin cytoskeleton signaling, mechanisms of viral exit from host cells, EIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) signaling, and the protein ubiquitination pathway. […] In conclusion, in humans with heart failure, plasma ACE2 is associated with various clinical factors known to be associated with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including older age, male sex, and diabetes mellitus, but is not associated with ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker use. […] Plasma ACE2 protein levels are prominently associated with multiple cellular pathways involved in cellular endocytosis, exocytosis, and intracellular protein trafficking.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptor - angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2).

[…] We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. […] SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable). […] Notably, we calculate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD lowers the binding strength of angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 44.2%. […] By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. […] These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infection susceptibility by SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a target for disease prevention.

[…] Moreover, the correlations of ACE2 with CS-induced oxidative stress-related markers, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were investigated. […] Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified the cause of ACE2 overexpression in human primary lung epithelial cells. […] We demonstrated that ACE2 was predominantly overexpressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, while reduced in alveolar epithelium, owing to the dramatically decreased abundance of alveolar type II pneumocytes in CS-exposed mouse lungs. […] Consistent with this, ACE2 was primarily significantly overexpressed in human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in smokers regardless of age or gender. […] Decreased ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from ex-smokers compared with current-smokers, especially in those who had ceased smoking for more than 10 years. […] Moreover, ACE2 expression was positively correlated with the levels of HIF-1α, iNOS, and 4-HNE in both mouse and human bronchioles. […] Finally, our results showed that HIF-1α transcriptionally upregulates ACE2 expression. […] Our results indicate that smoking-induced ACE2 overexpression in the apical surface of bronchial epithelial cells provide a route by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells, which supports clinical relevance in attenuating the potential transmission risk of COVID-19 in smoking populations by smoking cessation.

[…] Using confocal imaging, we found that ACE2 is expressed in human ASM. […] Furthermore, Western analysis of ASM cell lysates showed significantly lower ACE2 expression in females compared to males at baseline. […] In addition, ASM cells exposed to estrogen and testosterone for 24 h showed that testosterone significantly upregulates ACE2 expression in both males and females, whereas estrogen downregulates ACE2, albeit not significant compared to vehicle.

Concerns about the male fertility consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection have started to emerge, since epidemiologic studies observed that this coronavirus affects male patients more frequently and with increased severity, possibly because of the hormone-regulated expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. […] A disturbance in fertility is also expected based on studies of the previous SARS-CoV infection, which targets the same ACE2 receptor when entering the host cells. […] In addition, bioinformatics analyses reveal the abundant expression of ACE2 receptor in the male reproductive tissues, particularly in the testis. […] It has been proposed that pharmacological intervention favoring the angiotensin-(1-7)/ACE2/Mas receptor pathway and increasing ACE2 expression and activity could greatly prevent inflammatory lesions in this area.

[…] We have measured ACE2 mRNA expression using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in atrial biopsies of 81 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and we compared 62 patients that received ACEi/ARB vs. 19 patients that were not ACEi/ARB-treated. […] We found atrial ACE2 mRNA expression to be significantly increased in patients treated with an ACEi or an ARB, independent of potential confounding comorbidities. […] Interestingly, the cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression correlated significantly with the expression in white blood cells of 22 patients encouraging further evaluation if the latter may be used as a surrogate for the former. […] Similarly, analysis of 18 ventricular biopsies revealed a significant and independent increase in ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with end-stage heart failure that were treated with ACEi/ARB. […] On the other hand, cardiac unloading with a left ventricular assist device significantly reduced ventricular ACE2 mRNA expression. […] Treatment with ACEi/ARB is independently associated with an increased myocardial ACE2 mRNA expression in patients with coronary artery disease and in patients with end-stage heart failure. […] Nevertheless, haemodynamic factors seem to be equally important for regulation of cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression.

The purpose of this study was to examine the deltoid skin biopsy in twenty-three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most severely ill, for vascular complement deposition and correlate this with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA and protein localization and ACE2 expression. […] Microvascular complement deposition strongly colocalized in situ with the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins including spike glycoproteins in the endothelial cells as well as the viral receptor ACE2 in lesional and nonlesional skin; viral RNA was not evident. […] Microvascular SARS-CoV-2 viral protein, complement, and ACE2 expression was most conspicuous in the subcutaneous fat. […] It is concluded that complement activation is common in grossly normal skin, especially in the subcutaneous fat which may provide a link between severe disease and obesity, in people with severe COVID-19, and the strong colocalization with the ACE2 receptor and viral capsid proteins without viral RNA suggests that circulating viral proteins (ie, pseudovirions) may dock onto the endothelial of these microvessels and induce complement activation.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been highlighted for its role as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. […] This review summarizes current knowledge about ACE2 as a multifunctional protein, focusing on its relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). […] As an enzyme, ACE2 may be protective in IBD because it favors the counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system or deleterious because it metabolizes other anti-inflammatory/repairing elements. […] Meanwhile, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the impact of ACE2 expression/activity on infection is still under debate because no direct evidence has been reported and, again, both protective and deleterious pathways are possible. […] Research has shown that ACE2 regulates the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1, controlling tryptophan-associated intestinal inflammation and nutritional status. […] Finally, intact membrane-bound or shed soluble ACE2 can also trigger integrin signaling, modulating the response to anti-integrin biologic drugs used to treat IBD (such as vedolizumab) and fibrosis, a long-term complication of IBD. […] As such, future studies on ACE2 expression/activity in IBD can improve monitoring of the disease and explore an alternative pharmacological target.

[…] Here, we report the discovery of a novel, transcriptionally independent truncated isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). […] We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. […] In The Cancer Genome Atlas, the expression of dACE2 was enriched in squamous tumors of the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. […] In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 amino-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. […] Our results suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, an inflammatory tumor microenvironment or viral co-infections is unlikely to increase the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.

[…] We found that tumor tissues had higher expression levels of ACE2 compared with normal tissue in the kidney and the liver and lower expression levels in the lung. […] High expression levels of ACE2 were beneficial to survival in ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, although this was not the case in lung squamous cell carcinoma. […] For those with a better prognosis, there were significant positive correlations between ACE2 expression and immune infiltrates, including B cells, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells.

[…] Here, we review the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and its interactions with ACE2 and antibodies. […] Structural information of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and its complexes with ACE2 and antibodies can provide key input for the development of therapies and vaccines against the new coronavirus.

[…] In this study, we investigated the effect of these mutations as well as other Ala-scanning mutations on the stability of the RBD/ACE2 complex.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

[…] The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 mRNA than any other organ. […] Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (&lt;2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. […] Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. […] Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene as well as a new putative short form of ACE2.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is a membrane receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), whereas transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is involved in viral attachment. […] Together, tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may determine infection. […] Sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and CKD are clinical risk factors for COVID-19 severity, but the relationships between kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression and these clinical variables are unknown. […] ACE2 expression was similar in the tubulointerstitium of the two groups, but greater in females than males in HLD (P = 0.005) and CKD (P &lt; 0.0001). […] ACE2 expression was lower in glomeruli of CKD patients compared to HLD (P = 0.0002) and lower in males than females. […] There was a strong relationship between ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in the glomerulus (r = 0.51, P &lt; 0.0001). […] In CKD, there was a relationship between tubulointerstitial ACE2 expression and estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.36, P &lt; 0.0001) and age (r = -0.17, P = 0.03), but no relationship with BMI.

[…] As a counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. […] The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 for human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. […] Previous studies have shown that regulating the ACE2/RAS system is effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. […] Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV. […] Vitamin D was found to affect ACE2, the target of SARS-CoV-2; therefore, we propose that vitamin D might alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury induced by SARS-CoV-2 by modulating ACE2.

Nisin, a food-grade antimicrobial peptide produced by lactic acid bacteria has been examined for its probable interaction with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor, the site where spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds. […] Among the eight nisin variants examined, nisin H, nisin Z, nisin U and nisin A showed a significant binding affinity towards hACE2, higher than that of the RBD (receptor binding domain) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. […] The molecular interaction of nisin with hACE2 was investigated by homology modeling and docking studies. […] Further, binding efficiency of the most potent nisin H was evaluated through the interaction of hACE2:nisin H complex with RBD (receptor-binding domain) of SARS-CoV-2 and that of hACE2:RBD complex with nisin H. […] Here, nisin H acted as a potential competitor of RBD to access the hACE2 receptor. […] The study unravels for the first time that a globally used food preservative, nisin has the potential to bind to hACE2.

[…] With the recognition early in 2020 of ACE2 being the main receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the interest in this protein has dramatically increased. […] In this review, we will focus on kidney ACE2; its localization, its alterations in hypertension, diabetes, the effect of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) on ACE2 and the potential use of ACE2 recombinant proteins therapeutically for kidney disease.

ACE2 is a type I membrane protein with extracellular carboxypeptidase activity displaying a broad tissue distribution with highest expression levels at the brush border membrane (BBM) of small intestine enterocytes and a lower expression in stomach and colon. […] In small intestinal mucosa, ACE2 mRNA expression appears to increase with age and to display higher levels in patients taking ACE-inhibitors (ACE-I). […] There, ACE2 protein heterodimerizes with the neutral amino acid transporter Broad neutral Amino acid Transporter 1 (B0AT1) (SLC6A19) or the imino acid transporter Sodium-dependent Imino Transporter 1 (SIT1) (SLC6A20), associations that are required for the surface expression of these transport proteins. […] The heterodimerization of the carboxypeptidase ACE2 with B0AT1 is suggested to favor the direct supply of substrate amino acids to the transporter, but whether this association impacts the ability of ACE2 to mediate viral infection is not known. […] Correspondingly, the lack of ACE2 and the concurrent absence of B0AT1 expression in small intestine causes a decrease in l-tryptophan absorption, niacin deficiency, decreased intestinal antimicrobial peptide production, and increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice. […] Thus, the abundant expression of ACE2 in small intestine and its association with amino acid transporters appears to play a crucial role for the digestion of peptides and the absorption of amino acids and, thereby, for the maintenance of structural and functional gut integrity.

[…] We examined the outcome of anti-tumor necrosis factor and anti-interleukin-12/interleukin-23 treatment on SB and colonic ACE2 expression in 3 clinical trials. […] ACE2 levels were consistently reduced in SB CD and elevated in colonic UC compared with non-IBD controls. […] Elevated SB ACE2 was also associated with demographic features (age and elevated body mass index) associated with poor coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes. […] Within CD, SB ACE2 was reduced in patients subsequently developing complicated disease. […] Within UC, colonic ACE2 was elevated in active disease and in patients subsequently requiring anti-tumor necrosis factor rescue therapy. […] SB and colonic ACE2 expression in active CD and UC were restored by anti-cytokine therapy, most notably in responders. […] Reduced SB but elevated colonic ACE2 levels in IBD are associated with inflammation and severe disease, but normalized after anti-cytokine therapy, suggesting compartmentalization of ACE2-related biology in SB and colonic inflammation. […] The restoration of ACE2 expression with anti-cytokine therapy might be important in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and potentially explain reports of reduced morbidity from coronavirus disease 2019 in IBD patients treated with anti-cytokines.

[…] In present study, we retrieved sequence of 70 peptides from Antiviral Peptide Database (AVPdb), modelled them using 3D structure predicting web tool and docked them with receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and human host receptor ACE2 using peptide-protein docking. […] It was observed that peptides have more affinity towards ACE2 in comparison with spike RBD. […] Interestingly it was noticed that most of the peptides bind to RBM (residue binding motif) which is responsible for ACE2 binding at the interface of RBD while, for ACE2, peptides prefer to bind the core cavity rather than RBD binding interface. […] To further investigate how peptides at the interface of RBD or ACE2 alter the binding between RBD and ACE2, protein-protein docking of RBD and ACE2 with and without peptides was performed. […] Peptides, AVP0671 at RBD and AVP1244 at ACE2 interfaces significantly reduce the binding affinity and change the orientation of RBD and ACE2 binding.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a major receptor for some coronavirus infection, including SARS-COV-2, but is also a crucial determinant in anti-inflammation processes during the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) functioning - converting angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7. […] The decline in ACE2 expression that occurs with aging has been associated to the higher morbidity and mortality rates in older adults.

The spike glycoprotein plays a critical role in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by recognizing the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mediating fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. […] SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, similar to those of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, spontaneously samples different prefusion states with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) adopting ‘up’ or ‘down’ conformations, and the RBD ‘down’ to ‘up’ conformational change is required for ACE2 binding.

Although numerous drug and vaccine development efforts are underway, there are many outstanding questions on the mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and host cell entry. […] Here, we perform explicitly solvated, all-atom, molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length, membrane-bound ACE2 receptor in both an apo and spike RBD-bound state to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. […] A large degree of fluctuation in the full-length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. […] This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor toward the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. […] This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can potentially be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

[…] Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, an intense effort has been made to elucidate the biochemical determinants of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 interaction.

A central mechanism for COVID-19 pathophysiology has been proposed: imbalance of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE)1 and ACE2 (ACE2 being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] virus “receptor”) that results in tissue injury from angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated signaling. […] Other approaches related to the RAS pathway might be considered, for example, inhalational administration of ACEIs/ARBs (to deliver drugs directly to the lungs) and use of compounds with other actions (e.g., activation of ACE2, agonism of MAS1 receptors, β-arrestin-based Angiotensin receptor agonists, and administration of soluble ACE2 or ACE2 peptides).

ACE2 was observed as the cell surface receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. […] Interestingly, we also found ACE2 positivity inside the cell nucleus. […] The ACE2 levels changed during cell differentiation and aging and varied in distinct cell types. […] We observed ACE2 depletion in the aortas of aging female mice, similarly, the aging caused ACE2 decrease in the kidneys. […] Compared with that in the heart, brain and kidneys, the ACE2 level was the lowest in the mouse lungs. […] In mice exposed to nicotine, ACE2 was not changed in olfactory bulbs but in the lungs, ACE2 was upregulated in females and downregulated in males. […] These observations indicate the distinct gender-dependent properties of ACE2. […] Differentiation into enterocytes, and cardiomyocytes, caused ACE2 depletion. […] In contrast, vitamin D2 decreased the renin level while ACE2 was upregulated. […] Together, the ACE2 level is high in non-differentiated cells. […] Mostly, downregulation of ACE2 is accompanied by renin upregulation. […] Thus, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease should be further studied not only by considering the ACE2 level but also the whole renin-angiotensin system.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus enters the host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] Here, we report that the ACE2 protein is expressed in both endometrial epithelial and stromal cells in the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, and the expression increases in stromal cells in the secretory phase. […] It was observed that the ACE2 mRNA and protein abundance increased during primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) decidualization. […] Furthermore, HESCs transfected with ACE2-targeting siRNA impaired the full decidualization response, as evidenced by a lack of morphology change and lower expression of the decidualization markers PRL and IGFBP1. […] Additionally, in mice during pregnancy, the ACE2 protein was expressed in the uterine epithelial cells, and stromal cells increased through day 6 of pregnancy. […] Finally, progesterone induced Ace2 mRNA expression in mouse uteri more than vehicle or estrogen. […] These data establish a role for ACE2 in endometrial physiology, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may be able to enter endometrial stromal cells and elicit pathological manifestations in women with COVID-19, including an increased risk of early pregnancy loss.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular entry point for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)-the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] However, the effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-inhibition on ACE2 expression in human tissues of key relevance to blood pressure regulation and COVID-19 infection has not previously been reported. […] We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes, and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterized by RNA-sequencing. […] Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. […] We show no association between renal expression of ACE2 and either hypertension or common types of RAS inhibiting drugs. […] We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. […] Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[…] These in silico and ex vivo analyses demonstrated prominent expression of ACE2 in pancreatic ductal epithelium and microvasculature, but we found rare endocrine cell expression at the mRNA level.

This would require binding and entry of SARS-CoV-2 into β cells via co-expression of its canonical cell entry factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2); however, their expression in human pancreas has not been clearly defined. […] We analyzed six transcriptional datasets of primary human islet cells and found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were not co-expressed in single β cells. […] In pancreatic sections, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein was not detected in β cells from donors with and without diabetes. […] Instead, ACE2 protein was expressed in islet and exocrine tissue microvasculature and in a subset of pancreatic ducts, whereas TMPRSS2 protein was restricted to ductal cells. […] These findings reduce the likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 directly infects β cells in vivo through ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

[…] The present study provides a critical review of recently published information on RBD-hACE2 interaction and its inhibitors to control SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] The review highlighted the structural aspects of interaction between RBDhACE2 and involved amino acid residues. […] One of the important targets for viral invasion is its binding with cell surface receptor, hACE2, through RBD on S-protein. […] Mimicking of three residues on ACE2 (Lys31, Glu35 and Lys353 on B chain) provided hot target directed strategy for inhibition of early attachment of virus to the cell. […] Early screening of peptidic or non-peptidic molecules for inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction has been raised the hope for potential therapeutics against COVID-19. […] The higher affinity of molecules toward RBD than ACE2 is important factor for selectivity and minimization of ACE2 related adverse events on cardiovascular system, brain, kidney, and foetus development during pregnancy. […] Inhibition of RBD-hACE2 interaction by different molecular scaffolds can be used as a preferred strategy for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[…] Membrane-bound ACE2 is depleted as a result of this entry mechanism. […] The consequence is that the protective renin-angiotensin system (RAS), of which ACE2 is an essential component, is compromised through lack of production of the protective peptides angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-9), and therefore decreased stimulation of Mas (receptor Mas) and angiotensin AT2-receptors (AT2Rs), while angiotensin AT1-receptors (AT1Rs) are overstimulated due to less degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE2.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a multifunctional transmembrane protein recently recognised as the entry receptor of the virus causing COVID-19. […] In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is considered to exert cellular responses to counteract the activation of the RAS primarily through a receptor, Mas, in multiple organs including skeletal muscle. […] In contrast, there is relatively little evidence to support the protective role of ACE2 in skeletal muscle. […] The potential contribution of endogenous ACE2 to the regulation of Ang 1-7-mediated protection of these muscle pathologies is discussed in this review. […] Recent studies have suggested that ACE2 protects against ageing-associated muscle wasting (sarcopenia) through its function to modulate molecules outside of the RAS. […] Thus, the potential association of sarcopenia with ACE2 and the associated molecules outside of RAS is also presented herein. […] Further, we introduce the transcriptional regulation of muscle ACE2 by drugs or exercise, and briefly discuss the potential role of ACE2 in the development of COVID-19.

The infection occurs through binding of the virus with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell membrane. […] Here, we established a screening strategy to identify drugs that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cardiac cells and lung organoids. […] Target analysis of hit compounds revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. […] Treatment with antiandrogenic drugs reduced ACE2 expression and protected hESC-derived lung organoids against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Currently, the world is suffering from the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor to enter the host cells. […] The recombinant protein that contains only the ACE2 receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (Arg319 - Phe541), on the other hand, did not cause this activation.

The aim of the study was to characterize the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) functional networks with a focus on CVD. […] Using the network medicine approach and publicly available datasets, we investigated ACE2 tissue expression and described ACE2 interaction networks that could be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the heart, lungs and nervous system. […] We also performed miRNA-target predictions to identify which miRNAs regulate ACE2-related networks and could play a role in the COVID19 outcome. […] We found similar ACE2 expression confidence levels in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, supporting that heart tissue is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. […] Analysis of ACE2 interaction networks in infected hiPSC-CMs identified multiple hub genes with corrupted signaling which can be responsible for cardiovascular symptoms. […] Enrichment analysis revealed multiple diseases associated with the interaction networks of ACE2, especially cancerous diseases, obesity, hypertensive disease, Alzheimer’s disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and congestive heart failure. […] Among affected ACE2-network components connected with the SARS-Cov-2 interactome, we identified AGT (Angiotensinogen), CAT (Catalase), DPP4 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4), CCL2 (C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2), TFRC (Transferrin Receptor) and CAV1 (Caveolin-1), associated with cardiovascular risk factors. […] We described for the first time miRNAs which were common regulators of ACE2 networks and virus-related proteins in all analyzed datasets. […] The top miRNAs regulating ACE2 networks were miR-27a-3p, miR-26b-5p, miR-10b-5p, miR-302c-5p, hsa-miR-587, hsa-miR-1305, hsa-miR-200b-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, and hsa-miR-16-5p.

To identify drugs that could potentially be used to treat infection with SARS-CoV-2, a high throughput 384-well assay was developed to measure the binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral S1 protein to its main receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] The addition of culture media containing this protein, termed HiBIT-RBD, to cells expressing ACE2 led to binding that was specific to ACE2 and both time and concentration dependant, Binding could be inhibited by both RBD expressed in E. coli and by a full length S1 - Fc fusion protein (Fc-fused S1) expressed in eukaryotic cells. […] The mutation of residues that are known to play a role in the interaction of RBD with ACE2 also reduced binding.

It has been reported COVID-19 keeps substantial nucleotide similarity and shares common receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-Cov). […] Here, we investigated the gene expression of ACE2 and identified associated pathways of SARS-Cov as a useful reference for a deepening understanding of COVID-19. […] The results indicated the ACE2 was overexpressed in human airway epithelial cells (HAEs), especially at 72 h after SARS-Cov infection. […] We found ACE2 might regulate immune response through immunological activation-associated pathways in the process of in both SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov-2 infection, where the activation of B cells, macrophages, helper T cells 1 (Th1 cells) and the inhibition of Foxp3 + regulatory T (Treg) cells and CD8 + T cells were found to be prominent. […] Finally, significant correlation between ACE2 and JAK-STAT signaling pathway was identified which indicate that JAK-STAT signaling pathway might involve in the downstream action of the overactivation of ACE2.

Evidence shows that the SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in host cells as a viral invasion mechanism and can infect the lungs and the gut. […] Other viruses have already been linked to intestinal symptoms through binding to ACE2. […] In turn, this medical hypothesis article conjectures that the ACE2 downregulation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 internalization could lead to decreased activation of the mechanistic target of mTOR with increased autophagy and lead to intestinal dysbiosis, resulting in diarrhea. […] Although there are clues to other viruses that modulate the ACE2/gut/lungs axis, including the participation of autophagy and dysbiosis in the development of gastrointestinal symptoms, there is still no evidence of the ACE2/mTOR/autophagy pathway in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor responsible for SARS-CoV-2 access to human cells, and ACE2 expression is increased in patients with diabetes and hypertension treated with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers.

[…] In fact, in a single ACE2 molecule, 34 lysine residues are present in the extracellular portion, and at least one of these is co-involved in a fundamental hydrogen-bond interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD).

[…] The current paper described how carnosine, a naturally occurring supplement, can be an effective drug candidate for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on the basis of molecular docking and modeling to host ACE2 cocrystallized with nCoV spike protein. […] First, the starting point was ACE2 inhibitors and their structure-activity relationship (SAR). […] Parallel, at all stages, the authors performed bioactivity scoring to assess potential repurposed inhibitors at ACE2. […] Finally, investigators performed molecular docking and modeling of the identified drug candidate to host ACE2 with nCoV spike protein. […] Carnosine emerged as the best-known drug candidate to match ACE2 inhibitor structure. […] Preliminary docking was more optimal to ACE2 than the known typical angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitor (enalapril) and quite comparable to known or presumed ACE2 inhibitors. […] Viral spike protein elements binding to ACE2 were retained in the best carnosine pose in SwissDock at 1.75 Angstroms. […] Out of the three main areas of attachment expected to the protein-protein structure, carnosine bound with higher affinity to two compared to the known ACE2 active site. […] Carnosine has promising inhibitory interactions with host ACE2 and nCoV spike protein and hence could offer a potential mitigating effect against the current COVID-19 pandemic.

[…] The diversification of the ACE2 sequence due to ACE2 polymorphisms and alternative splicing has to a large extent affected the susceptibility of different species.

[…] We find that integration of both interaction energy with ACE2 and translational efficiency explains animal infectivity. […] Humans are the top species in which SARS-CoV-2 is both efficiently translated as well as optimally interacting with ACE2.

Twenty years ago, the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was an important breakthrough dramatically enhancing our understanding of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] More recently, it has been recognised that the protective RAS regulated by ACE2 counterbalances many of the deleterious effects of the classical RAS. […] Liver-specific overexpression of ACE2 in mice with liver fibrosis has proved to be highly effective in antagonising liver injury and fibrosis progression. […] Importantly, despite its highly protective role in disease pathogenesis, ACE2 is hijacked by SARS-CoV-2 as a cellular receptor to gain entry to alveolar epithelial cells, causing COVID-19, a severe respiratory disease in humans. […] As an unprecedented number of COVID-19 patients have been affected globally, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutics targeting the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2. […] Understanding the role of ACE2 in physiology, pathobiology and as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insight into potential new therapeutic strategies aiming to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection related tissue injury. […] This review outlines the role of the RAS with a strong focus on ACE2-driven protective RAS in liver disease and provides therapeutic approaches to develop strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

[…] As vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) activates nAChRs, we aimed to investigate whether VNS can be instrumental in affecting intestinal epithelial ACE2 expression. […] By using publicly available datasets we qualified epithelial ACE2 expression in human intestine, and assessed gene co-expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 priming Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with nAChRs in intestinal epithelial cells. […] Next, we investigated mouse and human ACE2 expression in intestinal tissues after chronic VNS via implanted devices. […] We show co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with nAChRs and α7 nAChR in particular in intestinal stem cells, goblet cells, and enterocytes. […] However, VNS did not affect ACE2 expression in murine or human intestinal tissue, albeit in colitis setting. […] ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically expressed in epithelial cells of human intestine, and both are co-expressed with nAChRs. […] However, no evidence for regulation of ACE2 expression through VNS could be found.

Among the putative links between hypertension and COVID-19 is a key counter-regulatory component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS): angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] ACE2 facilitates entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, into host cells. […] Because RAS inhibitors have been suggested to increase ACE2 expression, health-care providers and patients have grappled with the decision of whether to discontinue these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. […] We review how RAS and ACE2 biology may affect outcomes in COVID-19 through pulmonary and other systemic effects.

The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. […] Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. […] Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID-19-positive patients. […] We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. […] Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. […] These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

It has been speculated that renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may promote COVID-19 by increasing ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter host cells, along with the host protease TMPRSS2. […] Taking a reverse translational approach and by combining in situ hybridization, primary cell isolation, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and LC-MS/MS we studied lung and kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in diabetic mice mimicking host factors linked to severe COVID-19. […] In healthy young mice, neither the ACE inhibitor ramipril nor the AT1 receptor blocker telmisartan affected lung or kidney ACE2 or TMPRSS2, except for a small increase in kidney ACE2 protein with ramipril. […] In contrast, mice with comorbid diabetes (aging, high fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes) had heightened lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels and increased lung ACE2 activity. […] ACE2 was similarly upregulated in the kidneys of mice with comorbid diabetes compared to aged controls, whereas TMPRSS2 (primarily distal nephron) was highest in telmisartan-treated animals. […] Upregulation of lung ACE2 activity in comorbid diabetes may contribute to increased risk of severe COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 infects pulmonary epithelial cells through ACE2 receptors and causes ARDS.

[…] Here, we demonstrate that primary human ECs derived from lung, kidney, heart, brain, and umbilical veins require expression of recombinant ACE2 receptors in order to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. […] However, SARS-CoV-2 lytically infects ACE2-ECs and elicits procoagulative and inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 patients.

[…] The correlation between ACE2 expression and virus-related genes was analyzed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) database. […] Gene ontology (GO) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were performed to explore the roles of ACE2. […] ACE2 expression in the heart was significantly higher than that in the lung. […] Compared with the other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N (ANPEP) or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the mRNA and protein expression of ACE2 was increased in the heart. […] Moreover, the mRNA expression of ACE2 was substantially upregulated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. […] Importantly, the expression of ACE2 was positively correlated with genes that regulate viral reproduction and transmission. […] The GO and PPI analyses showed that the functions of proteins interacting with ACE2 were significantly enriched in the regulation of the viral process and inflammatory response. […] Our study provided bioinformatics evidence that the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 in the heart could contribute to COVID-19-mediated myocardial damage via the virus-induced cytopathic effect, triggering a cardiac inflammatory storm.

[…] Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. […] The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir.

[…] Soon after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the disease Covid-19, scientists found that ACE2 was also used by the new coronavirus to infect cells. […] There are several ways in which the ACE2 protein might contribute to this variation. […] The most obvious would be if there is more ACE2, there would be more entry points for the virus to infect the cell, e.g. in older people or in men. […] Alternatively, it could be related to ACE2 membership of a family of proteins that has one end of the protein anchored inside the cell while most of the protein protrudes from the outside of the cell which therefore can be shed when cleaved by proteases at the cell membrane.

[…] Compared to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 binds with ACE2 using a more robust strategy: The electric field line related residues are distributed quite differently, which results in a more robust binding strategy of SARS-CoV-2. […] Also, SARS-CoV-2 has a higher electric field line density than that of SARS-CoV, which indicates stronger interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2, compared to that of SARS-CoV.

[…] Their findings demonstrate that cigarette smoking increases ACE2 expression specifically at the apical surface of the airway epithelium. […] Smoking cessation resulted in lower ACE2 expression, with implications for attenuating the risk of transmission of the virus. […] The role of ACE2 expression in the development of COVID-19 symptoms is still under investigation, with conflicting results from experimental models on the role of ACE2 expression in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury. […] In this commentary, we highlight the implications and limitations of the study of Liu et al as well as future therapeutic strategies directed towards ACE2.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) is the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells. […] ACE2 exists as a membrane-bound protein on major viral target pulmonary epithelial cells, and its peptidase domain (PD) interacts SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with higher affinity. […] Therefore, targeting ACE2 is an important pharmacological intervention for a SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] In this review, we described the two-way switch role of ACE2 in the treatment of novel coronavirus pneumonia and underlying comorbidities, and discussed the potential effect of the ACE inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker on a hypertension patient with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] In addition, we analyzed the S-protein-binding site on ACE2 and suggested that blocking hot spot-31 and hot spot-353 on ACE2 could be a therapeutic strategy for preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. […] Besides, the recombinant ACE2 protein could be another potential treatment option for SARS-CoV-2 induced acute severe lung failure. […] This review could provide beneficial information for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents via targeting ACE2 and the clinical usage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) drugs for novel coronavirus pneumonia treatment.

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has brought into focus the key role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which serves as a cell surface receptor required for the virus to enter cells. […] SARS-CoV-2 can decrease cell surface ACE2 directly by internalization of ACE2 bound to the virus and indirectly by increased ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17)-mediated shedding of ACE2. […] ACE2 is widely expressed in the heart, lungs, vasculature, kidney and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, where it counteracts the deleterious effects of angiotensin II (AngII) by catalyzing the conversion of AngII into the vasodilator peptide angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)). […] The down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can be detrimental to the cardiovascular system and kidneys. […] Further, decreased ACE2 can cause gut dysbiosis, inflammation and potentially worsen the systemic inflammatory response and coagulopathy associated with SARS-CoV-2. […] This review aims to elucidate the crucial role of ACE2 both as a regulator of the renin-angiotensin system and a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as the implications for Coronavirus disease 19 and its associated cardiovascular and renal complications.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the host cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. […] ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II) to angiotensin (1-7), to balance the renin angiotensin system. […] Membrane-bound ACE2 ectodomain shedding is mediated by ADAM17 upon viral spike binding, Ang II overproduction and in several diseases. […] The shed soluble ACE2 (sACE2) retains its catalytic activity, but its precise role in viral entry is still unclear. […] Therapeutic sACE2 is claimed to exert dual effects; reduction of excess Ang II and blocking viral entry by masking the spike protein. […] Nevertheless, the paradox is why SARS-CoV-2 comorbid patients struggle to attain such benefit in viral infection despite having a high amount of sACE2. […] In this review, we discuss the possible detrimental role of sACE2 and speculate on a series of events where protease primed or non-primed virus-sACE2 complex might enter the host cell. […] As extracellular virus can bind many sACE2 molecules, sACE2 level could be reduced drastically upon endocytosis by the host cell. […] Hence, monitoring sACE2 and Ang II level in coronavirus disease 2019 comorbid patients are crucial to ensure safe and efficient intervention using therapeutic sACE2 and vaccines.

The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. […] Interaction between ACE2 and SARS-CoV2 spike protein seems to alter the function of ACE2, a key player in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). […] We propose that RAS balance could be restored in COVID-19 patients through MasR activation downstream of ACE2 activity, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (BIO101) a non-peptidic Mas receptor (MasR) activator.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main entry point in airway epithelial cells for SARS-CoV-2. […] ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 protein spike triggers viral fusion with the cell plasma membrane, resulting in viral RNA genome delivery into the host. […] Despite ACE2’s critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, full understanding of ACE2 expression, including in response to viral infection, remains unclear. […] ACE2 was thought to encode five transcripts and one protein of 805 amino acids. […] In the present study, we identify a novel short isoform of ACE2 expressed in the airway epithelium, the main site of SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Short ACE2 is substantially upregulated in response to interferon stimulation and rhinovirus infection, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] This short isoform lacks SARS-CoV-2 spike high-affinity binding sites and, altogether, our data are consistent with a model where short ACE2 is unlikely to directly contribute to host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase that forms a dimer and serves as the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). […] ACE2 is also a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates vascular functions. […] We report here the properties of a trimeric ACE2 ectodomain variant, engineered using a structure-based approach. […] The trimeric ACE2 variant has a binding affinity of ~60 pM for the spike protein of SARS‑CoV‑2 (compared with 77 nM for monomeric ACE2 and 12-22 nM for dimeric ACE2 constructs), and its peptidase activity and the ability to block activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 in the renin-angiotensin system are preserved. […] Moreover, the engineered ACE2 potently inhibits SARS‑CoV‑2 infection in cell culture. […] These results suggest that engineered, trimeric ACE2 may be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for treating COVID-19.

[…] ACE2 is part of the counter-regulatory renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and is also expressed in the lower respiratory tract along the alveolar epithelium. […] There is, however, significant controversy regarding the role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 pathogenesis. […] Some have argued that decreasing ACE2 expression would result in decreased susceptibility to the virus by decreasing available binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 and restricting viral entry into the cells. […] Others have argued that, like the pathogenesis of other viral pneumonias, including those stemming from previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses, once SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, it downregulates ACE2 expression. […] Lack of the favourable effects of ACE2 might exaggerate lung injury by a variety of mechanisms. […] In order to help address this controversy, we conducted a literature search and review of relevant preclinical and clinical publications pertaining to SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, ACE2, viral pneumonia, SARS, acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung injury. […] Our review suggests, although controversial, that patients at increased susceptibility to COVID-19 complications may have reduced baseline ACE2, and by modulating ACE2 expression one can possibly improve COVID-19 outcomes.

[…] We showed that while global similarities reflected by whole ACE2 gene alignments are poor predictors of high-risk mammals, local similarities at key S protein-binding sites highlight several high-risk mammals that share good ACE2 homology with human. […] Bats are likely reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2, but there are other high-risk mammals that share better ACE2 homologies with human. […] Yet, among host-specific coronaviruses infecting high-risk mammals, key ACE2-binding sites on S proteins share highest similarities between SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV and between SARS-CoV and Civet-CoV.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the host by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). […] The role of ACE2 in the pathophysiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a topic of debate, with clinical and experimental evidence indicating a multifaceted relationship between ACE2 activity and disease severity. […] Here, we review the mechanisms by which the peptidergic substrates and products of ACE and ACE2 contribute to physiological and pathophysiological processes and hypothesise how down-regulation of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry disrupts homeostasis. […] A better understanding of the endocrinology of the disease, in particular the neuroendocrinology of ACE2 during COVID-19, may contribute to the timely design of new therapeutic strategies, including the regulation of ACE2 itself by steroid hormones, to ameliorate the severity of COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2 entry to the host-mediated by binding of viral spike protein to the Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.

[…] Although ACE2 receptor is the entry point to the host, recent studies show activation of ACE2 to modulate the host to develop a suitable environment for its replication. […] However, the ACE2 activating the immune signals on SARS-CoV-2 attachment is still under investigation. […] We have used a systems biological approach to construct the host regulatory network upon SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the ACE2 receptor. […] The constructed network contains 133 host proteins with 298 interactions that directly or indirectly connect to the ACE2 receptor. […] Overall, our results will help advance our understanding of the immune molecular regulatory network influenced by the ACE2 mediated interaction in other body tissues, which could help in finding the secondary health complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The cellular receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), thereby implicating a link between cardiovascular diseases and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility. […] The circulating ACE2 levels were measured in 111 patients with severe AS and compared to patients with hypertension and healthy individuals. […] About 4 times higher circulating ACE2 activity was found in patients with severe AS than in hypertensives or healthy individuals (88.3 ± 61.6., n = 111, 20.6 ± 13.4, n = 540, and 16.1 ± 7.4 mU/L, n = 46, respectively). […] Serum ACE2 activity correlated negatively with the left ventricular ejection fraction, aortic root area, TAPSE, and positively with the right ventricular systolic pressure, cardiac diameters in patients with AS. […] In contrast, circulating ACE2 activity was independent of the blood pressure, peak flow velocity at the aortic root, kidney function (GFR), and inflammatory state (CRP). […] We found no effect of RAAS inhibitory drugs on the serum ACE2 activity in this group of patients. […] Our results illustrate circulating ACE2 as a potential interface between chronic inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 susceptibility. […] Elderly patients with AS have markedly elevated ACE2 levels together with altered left and right ventricular functions, which may pose higher risks during COVID-19.

[…] We replaced the three residues in SARS-CoV (BJ01 strain) S with their counterparts in WIV1 S, and then evaluated the change of their utilization of bat, civet, and human ACE2s using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus infection system. […] To further validate the S-ACE2 interactions, the binding affinity between the RBDs of these S proteins and the three ACE2s were verified by flow cytometry. […] The results showed that the single amino acid substitution Y442S in the RBD of BJ01 S enhanced its utilization of bat ACE2 and its binding affinity to bat ACE2. […] On the contrary, the reverse substitution in WIV1 S (S442Y) significantly attenuated the pseudovirus utilization of bat, civet and human ACE2s for cell entry, and reduced its binding affinity with the three ACE2s.

The key link between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and COVID-19 is ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), which acts as a double-edged sword, because ACE2 increases the tissue anti-inflammatory response but it is also the entry receptor for the virus. […] There is an important controversy on several drugs that regulate RAS activity and possibly ACE2, and are widely used, particularly by patients most vulnerable to severe COVID-19. […] In the lung of healthy rats, we observed that candesartan (an angiotensin type-1, AT1, receptor blocker; ARB) and captopril (an ACE inhibitor; ACEI) up-regulated expression of tissue ACE2 and RAS anti-inflammatory axis receptors (AT2 and Mas receptors). […] Treatment of cultures of human type-II pneumocytes with candesartan or captopril induced up-regulation of ACE2 expression in cells. […] Treatment with viral spike protein induced a decrease in full-length (i.e. transmembrane) ACE2, an increase in levels of a short intracellular ACE2 polypeptide and an increase in ADAM17 activity in cells, together with an increase in levels of soluble ACE2 and major proinflammatory cytokines in the culture medium. […] The results suggest that these drugs increase ACE2 levels and promote the anti-inflammatory RAS axis in the lung. […] Furthermore, possible up-regulation of viral entry by the drug-induced increase in expression of transmembrane ACE2 is counteracted by additional mechanisms, particularly by drug-induced inhibition of ADAM17 activity.

The efficacy of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 critically depends on the availability of its receptor, ACE2, in the placenta. […] In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that placental ACE2 expression is oxygenation-dependent by studying the expression of ACE2 and associated cell entry regulators in the monochorionic twin anemia-polycythemia (TAPS) placenta, a model of discordant placental oxygenation. […] We performed a retrospective comparative immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B expression in anemic and polycythemic territories of TAPS placentas (N = 14). […] ACE2 protein levels were significantly higher in the anemic twin territories than in the corresponding polycythemic territories, associated with upregulation of the key ACE2-related cell entry regulators, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B, immunolocalized to villous trophoblastic and stromal cells. […] Cellular colocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, suggestive of functionality of this cell entry axis, was demonstrated by double immunofluorescence studies. […] Placental hypoxia is associated with upregulation of ACE2 expression, concomitant with increased expression of its key cell entry proteases. […] ACE2-regulated placental functions, both infection- and non-infection related, may be highly oxygenation-dependent.

Protruding from the viral surface is a densely glycosylated spike (S) protein, which engages angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to mediate host cell entry. […] However, studies have reported viral susceptibility in intra- and extrapulmonary immune and non-immune cells lacking ACE2, suggesting that the S protein may exploit additional receptors for infection. […] Recognition of carbohydrate moieties clustered on the surface of the S protein may drive receptor-dependent internalization, accentuate severe immunopathological inflammation, and allow for systemic spread of infection, independent of ACE2.

Soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (sACE2) could be a therapeutic option to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. […] Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) utilizes ACE2 receptors on cell surfaces to gain intracellular entry making them an ideal target for therapy. […] High-affinity variants of sACE2, engineered using high-throughput mutagenesis, are capable of neutralizing COVID-19 infection as decoy receptors. […] These variants compete with native ACE2 present on cells by binding with spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV2, making native ACE2 on cell surfaces available to convert angiotensin-II to angiotensin-1,7, thus alleviating the exaggerated inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 infection.

[…] Predicted effects of changes in ACE2 expression with comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, or aging on mas-AT1 occupancy ratio were also relatively small.

[…] We found that ACE2 expression was significantly increased in the lungs and digestive tract. […] The cellular immunity of individuals with elevated ACE2 expression is activated, whereas humoral immunity is dampened, leading to the release of many inflammatory factors dominated by IL6.

[…] Inhibiting or reducing cell surface availability of ACE2 represents a promising therapy for tackling COVID-19. […] In this context, most ACE2-based therapeutic strategies have aimed to tackle the virus through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or neutralizing the virus by exogenous administration of ACE2, which does not directly aim to reduce its membrane availability. […] However, through this review, we present a different perspective focusing on the subcellular localization and trafficking of ACE2.

[…] Correlations were evaluated by Pearsons’s correlation co-efficient and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate differences in disease-free survival between the ACE2 high and ACE2 low groups. […] There is minimal expression of ACE2 in the luminal classes, but significantly higher levels in the Basal-like and HER2-enriched subclasses.

[…] ACE2 protein was only present in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL embryos, but other ACE2 protein variants were observed in all the samples. […] Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases combination (ACE2/TMPRSS2 or CD147/CTSL) in high abundance. […] Co-expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in MII oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts demonstrate that these gametes and embryos have the cellular machinery required and thus are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection if exposed to the virus.

The objective of this study was to compare the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the two Korean bat CoV strains 16BO133 and B15-21, to estimate the likelihood of an interaction between the Korean bat CoVs and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. […] Specifically, the spike gene of the Korean CoVs, which is involved in host infection, differed from that of SARS-CoV-2, showing only 66.8%-67.0% nucleotide homology and presented deletions within the RBD, particularly within regions critical for cross-species transmission and that mediate interaction with ACE2. […] Binding free energy calculation revealed that the binding affinity of Korean bat CoV RBD to hACE2 was drastically lower than that of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. […] These results suggest that Korean bat CoVs are unlikely to bind to the human ACE2 receptor.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) is the cell receptor of SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent of COVID-19. […] ACE2 and a network of further enzymes and receptors constitute the non-classical renin-angiotensin system. […] ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II, which promotes vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, liver and lung inflammation and fibrosis, into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), which binds to Mas receptors (MasR), resulting in arterial vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in tissues. […] Viral binding to ACE2 allows viral entry into human cells including hepatocytes, followed by viral replication and host cell depletion of ACE2. […] The coronavirus-dependent demise of ACE2 and its product (Ang1-7) leads to cytokine activation and cytokine-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis, which in turn decreases liver reserve and may induce hepatic injury. […] Moreover, SF2809E, an inhibitor of serine protease chymase (an enzyme generating most tissue angiotensin II) may also block TMPRRS2, a host serine protease that primes SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein before adhesion to ACE2.

[…] At the same time, CLAM exhibited a good binding affinity of -6.4 kcal/mol, making it an excellent tool to block the attachment of spike protein to ACE2 receptors. […] Macrolides not only affected the attachment to ACE2 but also blocked the spike proteins further, consequently inhibiting the internalization in the host cell. […] The present study gives three-way options either by blocking S proteins or ACE2 receptor proteins or inhibiting RdRp to counter any effect of COVID-19 by macrolide and could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19 till some better option available.

By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells and affects many organs, including the brain. […] However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. […] Here, we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. […] According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus. […] According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in the human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. […] A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. […] Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in the mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. […] Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brains, which indicates that the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

[…] However, as ACE2 may play a dual role in mediating susceptibility and immunity to SARS‑CoV‑2 infection, the role of ACE2 in viral infection is controversial. […] Beginning with the physiological function of ACE2, the present review article summarizes the influence of the ACE2 content on the susceptibility to the virus and acute lung injury. […] Drug mechanisms were taken as the starting point, combined with the results of clinical trials, specifically elaborating upon and analyzing the efficacy of several ACE2‑centered therapeutic drugs and their potential effects. […] In addition, the current status of ACE2 as a targeted therapy for COVID‑19 is discussed in order to provide new insight into the clinical prevention and treatment of COVID‑19.

SARS‑CoV‑2 infection is initiated when the virus interacts with angiotensin‑converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells. […] Through this mechanism, the virus infects the alveolar, esophageal epithelial, ileum, colon and other cells on which ACE2 is highly expressed, causing damage to target organs. […] However, increased ACE2 expression may upregulate the viral load indirectly by increasing the baseline level of infectious virus particles.

Given the requirement of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, here we discuss how the downregulation of ACE2 in the COVID-19 patients and virus-induced shift in ACE2 catalytic equilibrium, change the concentrations of substrates such as angiotensin II, apelin-13, dynorphin-13, and products such as angiotensin (1-7), angiotensin (1-9), apelin-12, dynorphin-12 in the human body. […] In this review, we focus on the viral-induced imbalance between ACE2 substrates and products which exacerbates the severity of COVID-19. […] Considering the roadmap, we propose multiple therapeutic strategies aiming to rebalance the products of ACE2 and to ameliorate the symptoms of the disease.

SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect human cells by binding its spike (S) protein to angiotensin-conversing enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed abundantly in several cell types and tissues. […] ACE2 has extensive biological activities as a component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and plays a pivotal role as counter-regulator of angiotensin II (Ang II) activity by converting the latter to Ang (1-7). […] Virion binding to ACE2 for host cell entry leads to internalization of both via endocytosis, as well as activation of ADAM17/TACE, resulting in downregulation of ACE2 and loss of its protective actions in the lungs and other organs. […] In fact, all human structures that express ACE2 are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to the downstream effects of reduced ACE2 levels, namely systemic inflammation and injury.

To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted the two most crucial agents, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-X-C motif 10 (CXCL10). […] ACE2 is a receptor protein that plays a vital role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell and CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm. […] By using the UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). […] We then identified the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences using the cBioPortal web portal. […] Here, we found that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are involved respectively in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection. […] Finally, based on this systemic analysis, we concluded that ACE2 and CXCL10 are two possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been reported as the primary host-cell receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of COVID-19. […] In this study, we screened ACE2 ligands from Radix Scutellariae and investigated its suppressive effect on SARS-CoV-2 spiked pseudotyped virus in vitro. […] HEK293T cells stably expressing ACE2 receptors (ACE2 cells) were used to provide the receptor for the ACE2/cell membrane chromatography (CMC) method used for analysis. […] The SARS-CoV-2-spiked pseudotyped virus was used to examine the anti-viropexis effect of the screened compounds in ACE2 cells. […] Oroxylin A exhibited an appreciable suppressive effect against the entrance of the SARS-CoV-2-spiked pseudotyped virus into ACE2 cells, which showed good binding to ACE2 as determined using SPR and CMC. […] Oroxylin A was shown to be a potential candidate in the treatment for COVID-19 by virtue of its blocking the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 into ACE2 cells by specifically binding to the ACE2 receptor.

SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the host ACE2 receptor for infection. […] Whether ACE2 abundance in the lung contributes to age-associated vulnerability is currently unknown. […] We set out to characterize the RNA and protein expression profiles of ACE2 in aging human lung in the context of phenotypic parameters likely to affect lung physiology. […] Examining publicly available RNA sequencing data, we discovered that mechanical ventilation is a critical variable affecting lung ACE2 levels. […] Therefore, we investigated ACE2 protein abundance in patients either requiring mechanical ventilation or spontaneously breathing. […] ACE2 distribution and expression were determined in archival lung samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). […] Within the alveolated parenchyma, ACE2 expression is predominantly observed in type II pneumocytes (or alveolar type II / AT2 cells) and alveolar macrophages. […] In these cases, ACE2 was strongly upregulated with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.004) or cellularity (p = 0.003), associated with prominent expression in AT2 cells. […] In non-ventilated individuals, AT2 cell reactive changes were not observed and ACE2 expression did not change with age when normalized to lung area (p = 0.231) or cellularity (p = 0.349). […] In summary, ACE2 expression increases with age in the setting of alveolar damage observed in patients on mechanical ventilation, providing a potential mechanism for higher Covid-19 mortality in the elderly.
