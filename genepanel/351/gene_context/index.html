Genome Detective is a web-based, user-friendly software application to quickly and accurately assemble all known virus genomes from next generation sequencing datasets. […] This application allows the identification of phylogenetic clusters and genotypes from assembled genomes in FASTA format. […] The tool can accept up to 2,000 sequences per submission and the analysis of a new whole genome sequence will take approximately one minute. […] The tool also allows tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease. <a href="https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov" class="uri">https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/cov</a>.

As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 and with seasonal influenza, geographic information systems and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real-or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time, are proving indispensable for timely and effective epidemic monitoring and response. […] This paper offers pointers to, and describes, a range of practical online/mobile GIS and mapping dashboards and applications for tracking the 2019/2020 coronavirus epidemic and associated events as they unfold around the world. […] Some of these dashboards and applications are receiving data updates in near-real-time (at the time of writing), and one of them is meant for individual users (in China) to check if the app user has had any close contact with a person confirmed or suspected to have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the recent past.

We conclude that viral spread is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing, but could be controlled if this process was faster, more efficient and happened at scale. […] A contact-tracing App which builds a memory of proximity contacts and immediately notifies contacts of positive cases can achieve epidemic control if used by enough people.

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. […] The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. […] We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. […] Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create “checkpoints” for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. […] Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. […] This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.

Three documents containing institutional information concerning screening, local containment procedures, and frequently asked questions and answers for parents were made available to the staff through a mobile app developed in the University of Geneva, Switzerland. […] In a survey, medical staff found the information easy to find within the app. […] On a 10-point Likert scale, the ability of the app to reassure staff in clinical practice was rated as 7.6 (SD 2.1), time-saving ability was rated as 8.5 (SD 2.1), and the need to look for information from other sources was rated as 5.9 (SD 3.3).

Methods: A social media monitoring conducted through a qualitative design to analyze the discussions of social media users about the content related to COVID-19 transferred via Iranian medical faculty members` groups in Telegram and Whats App during Feb 20 to March 20, 2020 emphasizing the misinformation. […] Discourse analysis was applied and the written dialogues and discussions regarding misinformation about different aspects of the outbreak between medical faculty members all over the country were analyzed.

Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. […] Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. […] The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. […] The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England’s guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. […] Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. […] Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. […] This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. […] The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. […] This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.

As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID-19 Symptom Tracker mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. […] This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. […] The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae.

[…] We used the app as part of an active epidemiological investigation executed at a Public Health Center. […] Among them, 57 had adopted the use of the health observation app. […] Before introduction of the app, all health observers would have been interviewed by telephone, a slow process that took four epidemiological officers more than 2 hours. […] After the introduction of the app, a single epidemiological officer can carry out health observations. […] The app was distributed for free beginning in early March, and by mid-May it had been used by more than 20,280 users and 400 facilities/organizations across Japan.

Our objective is to assess the potential contribution of the Australian Government’s mobile smartphone tracing app (COVIDSafe) to the sustained control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] To define the pandemic context and specify model-building parameters, we searched for literature on COVID-19, its epidemiology in Australia, case finding processes, and factors that might affect community acceptance of the COVIDSafe smartphone app for contact tracing. […] We applied the model to examine factors influencing the projected trends: the extent of viral testing, community participation in social distancing, and the level of uptake of the COVIDSafe app. […] At the app uptake level of approximately 27% (current at 20 May 2020), with a monthly 50% reduction in social distancing (i.e. the average number of contacts per day doubling every 30 days until they reach pre-social distancing rates) and a 5% decline in testing, the app would reduce the projected total number of new cases during April-December 2020 by one-quarter. […] The COVIDSafe smartphone app has the potential to be an important adjunct to testing and social distancing. […] Depending on the level of community uptake of the app, it could have a significant mitigating effect on a second wave of COVID-19 in Australia.

Mobile health (mHealth) app use is a major concern because of the possible dissemination of misinformation that could harm the users. […] Particularly, it can be difficult for health care professionals to recommend a suitable app for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) education and self-monitoring purposes. […] This study aims to analyze and evaluate the contents as well as features of COVID-19 mobile apps. […] The findings are instrumental in helping health care professionals to identify suitable mobile apps for COVID-19 self-monitoring and education. […] The results of the mobile apps’ assessment could potentially help mobile app developers improve or modify their existing mobile app designs to achieve optimal outcomes. […] The search for the mHealth apps available in the android-based Play Store and the iOS-based App Store was conducted between April 18 and May 5, 2020. […] The region of the App Store where we performed the search was the United States, and a virtual private network app was used to locate and access COVID-19 mobile apps from all countries on the Google Play Store. […] The inclusion criteria were apps that are related to COVID-19 with no restriction in language type. […] The basic features assessment criteria used for comparison were the requirement for free subscription, internet connection, education or advisory content, size of the app, ability to export data, and automated data entry. […] The functionality of the apps was assessed according to knowledge (information on COVID-19), tracing or mapping of COVID-19 cases, home monitoring surveillance, online consultation with a health authority, and official apps run by health authorities. […] Of the 223 COVID-19-related mobile apps, only 30 (19.9%) found in the App Store and 28 (44.4%) in the Play Store matched the inclusion criteria. […] In the basic features assessment, most App Store (10/30, 33.3%) and Play Store (10/28, 35.7%) apps scored 4 out of 7 points. […] Meanwhile, the outcome of the functionality assessment for most App Store apps (13/30, 43.3%) was a score of 3 compared to android-based apps (10/28, 35.7%), which scored 2 (out of the maximum 5 points). […] Evaluation of the basic functions showed that 75.0% (n=36) of the 48 included mobile apps do not require a subscription, 56.3% (n=27) provide symptom advice, and 41.7% (n=20) have educational content. […] In terms of the specific functions, more than half of the included mobile apps are official mobile apps maintained by a health authority for COVID-19 information provision. […] Around 37.5% (n=18) and 31.3% (n=15) of the mobile apps have tracing or mapping and home monitoring surveillance functions, respectively, with only 17% (n=8) of the mobile apps equipped with an online consultation function. […] Most iOS-based apps incorporate infographic mapping of COVID-19 cases, while most android-based apps incorporate home monitoring surveillance features instead of providing focused educational content on COVID-19. […] It is important to evaluate the contents and features of COVID-19 mobile apps to guide users in choosing a suitable mobile app based on their requirements.

Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of physical distancing. […] The effect of minimising tracing delay (eg, with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage, reducing the reproduction number by 17·6% compared with 2·5%. […] Optimising testing and tracing coverage and minimising tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced contact tracing effectiveness, with the potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. […] Access to testing should therefore be optimised, and mobile app technology might reduce delays in the contact tracing process and optimise contact tracing coverage.

[…] Perceived severity and perceived susceptibility were not related to app uptake intention. […] Moreover, cues to action (ie, individuals’ exposure to [digital] media content) were positively associated with app use intention. […] As the respondents’ age increased, their perceived benefits and self-efficacy for app usage decreased. […] Initiatives to stimulate the uptake of contact tracing apps should enhance perceived benefits and self-efficacy.

One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. […] However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. […] This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. […] As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. […] The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. […] We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. […] We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. […] Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. […] Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. […] The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.

[…] All participants in the focus group believed in the potential of a mobile app to monitor gingivitis and reduce its severity. […] The 5 cycles of development highlighted the importance of communication between dentists, app developers, and the pilot group. […] Qualitative analysis of the data from the pilot study showed difficulty with: (1) the camera, which was alleviated with the provision of mouth openers, and (2) the operation of the phone, which was alleviated by changing the app to be fully automated, with a weekly reminder and an instructions document. […] Final interviews showed satisfaction. iGAM is the first mHealth app for monitoring gingivitis using self-photography. iGAM facilitates the information flow between dentists and patients between checkups and may be useful when face-to-face consultations are not possible (such as during the COVID-19 pandemic).

[…] However we argue that, while detection of cases have still not been reported after 10 days and one million app downloads - a situation comparable to Australia who launched its app a month before -, the adoption of the app generates important risks to our informational privacy, surveillance and habituation to security policies.

As an example, the messenger app WhatsApp was adopted by both the World Health Organization and government agencies to provide updates on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). […] In this study, we sought to accomplish the following: (1) assess well-being during the pandemic; (2) replicate prior findings linking exposure to COVID-19 news with psychological distress; and (3) examine whether subscription to an official WhatsApp channel can mitigate this risk. […] As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to the following: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news; (2) their use of the Singapore government’s WhatsApp channel; and (3) their demographics. […] Depression scores were associated with increased time spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b=-0.07, t[863]=-2.04, P=.04). […] Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumors, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government’s WhatsApp messages (b=-0.05, t[863]=-2.13, P=.03). […] Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the amount of time spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use. […] Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium for disseminating pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly.

Understanding this variance amongst different sectors of society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk to be determined to enable strategies to be applied to different groups. […] To overcome the limitation of long-established compartmental epidemiological models, it is proposed that a modified model, namely SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. […] This enables the analysis of the spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. […] One option could be the provision of a wristband to vulnerable people and those without a smartphone and contact-tracing app, filling the gap created by systems relying on smartphone apps only. […] By combining very dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be protected and kept safer.

[…] The system was trained on a set of 128 overnights recorded at a sleep laboratory, where volunteers underwent simultaneous full polysomnography (PSG), and “Firefly” smartphone app analysis. […] A separate independent test set of 120 recordings was collected across a range of Apple iOS and Android smartphones, and withheld for performance evaluation by a different team. […] The performance on the test set is comparable to ambulatory OSA screeners, and other smartphone screening apps, with a sensitivity of 88.3% and specificity of 80.0% [with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92], for a clinical threshold for the AHI of ≥15 events/hour of detected sleep time. […] The “Firefly” app based sensing technology offers the potential to significantly lower the barrier of entry to OSA screening, as no hardware (other than the user’s personal smartphone) is required.

[…] Of survey participants, 37% had downloaded the COVIDSafe app, 19% intended to, 28% refused, and 16% were undecided. […] Equally proportioned reasons for not downloading the app included privacy (25%) and technical concerns (24%). […] Other reasons included a belief that social distancing was sufficient and the app is unnecessary (16%), distrust in the Government (11%), and apathy (11%). […] Conclusion: For the COVIDSafe app to be accepted by the public and used correctly, public health messages need to address the concerns of its citizens, specifically privacy, data storage, and technical capabilities. […] Understanding the specific barriers preventing the uptake of tracing apps provides the opportunity to design targeted communication strategies aimed at strengthening public health initiatives such as download and correct use.

[…] Fifty-nine percent identified at least one reason not to download the App, with the most common reasons being fear that technology companies or the government might use the App technology for greater surveillance after the pandemic. […] The Irish citizens surveyed expressed high levels of willingness to download a public health-backed App to augment contact tracing. […] Concerns raised regarding privacy and data security will be critical if the App is to achieve the large-scale adoption and ongoing use required for its effective operation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited wider clinical adoption of digital health tools, including mobile health apps (mHealth apps), to address mental and behavioral health concerns at a distance. […] While mHealth apps offer many compelling benefits, identifying effective apps in the crowded and largely unregulated marketplace is laborious. […] Consumer demand and industry productivity are increasing, although research is slower, making it challenging for providers to determine the most credible and safe apps for patients in need. […] This commentary offers a practical, empirically guided framework and associated resources for selecting appropriate mHealth apps for pediatric populations during the pandemic and beyond. […] In the first stage, Narrow the target problem, end user, and contender apps. […] Beginning the search with continuously updated websites that contain expert app ratings can help expedite this process (e.g., Psyberguide). […] Second, Explore each contender app’s: (a) scientific and theoretical support (e.g., are app components consistent with health behavior change theories?), (b) privacy policies, and (c) user experience (e.g., through crowdsourcing feedback about app usability and appeal via social media). […] Third, use clinical expertise and stakeholder feedback to Contextualize whether the selected app is a good fit for a particular patient and/or caregiver (e.g., by considering age, race/ethnicity, ability, gender, sexual orientation, technology access), including conducting a brief self-pilot of the app. […] We offer additional recommendations for rapidly disseminating evidence-based apps to the public.

Self-help smartphone apps offer a new opportunity to address youth suicide prevention by improving access to support and by providing potentially high fidelity and cost-effective treatment. […] However, there have been very few smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this population. […] To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life. […] This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years. […] This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). […] The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. […] A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. […] To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys. […] This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal thoughts.

The UK National Health Service (NHS) Track and Trace Service has plans for a nationwide app that notifies the need for self-isolation to those in contact with a person testing positive for COVID-19. […] To be successful, such an app will require high uptake, the determinants and willingness for which are unclear but essential to understand for effective public health benefit. […] The objective of this study was to measure the determinants of willingness to participate in an NHS app-based contact-tracing programme using a questionnaire within the Care Information Exchange (CIE)-the largest patient-facing electronic health record in the NHS. […] Among 47,708 registered NHS users of the CIE, 27% completed a questionnaire asking about willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing, understanding of government advice, mental and physical wellbeing and their healthcare utilisation-related or not to COVID-19. […] Descriptive statistics are reported alongside univariate and multivariable logistic regression models, with positive or negative responses to a question on app-based contact tracing as the dependent variable. […] 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing. […] Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact-tracing app, respectively; when compared to those who rated their understanding as 5-6/10 (OR for 1-2/10 = 0.57 [CI 0.48-0.67]; OR for 3-4/10 = 0.744 [CI 0.64-0.87]), whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. […] Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app; belief of previous recovery from COVID-19 infection OR 0.727 [0.585-0.908]). […] In this large UK-wide questionnaire of wellbeing in lockdown, a willingness for app-based contact tracing over an appropriate age range is 60%-close to the estimated 56% population uptake, and substantially less than the smartphone-user uptake considered necessary for an app-based contact tracing to be an effective intervention to help suppress an epidemic. […] Difficulty comprehending government advice and uncertainty of diagnosis, based on a public health policy of not testing to confirm self-reported COVID-19 infection during lockdown, therefore reduce willingness to adopt a government contact-tracing app to a level below the threshold for effectiveness as a tool to suppress an epidemic.

[…] Results suggest that a contact tracing app can contribute substantially to reducing infection rates in the population when accompanied by a sufficient testing capacity or when the testing policy prioritises symptomatic cases. […] With that, when symptomatic cases are not prioritised for testing, a high rate of app users can generate an extensive increase in the demand for testing, which, if not met with adequate supply, may render the app counterproductive.

[…] This prospective feasibility study aimed to evaluate the health economic effects (in terms of clinical workload) of a mobile app on a telephone-based virtual ward used in the monitoring of patients with COVID-19 who are clinically ready for discharge from the hospital. […] A smartphone-based app was introduced to monitor data points submitted by the patients via communication over telephone calls. […] We then comparatively evaluated the clinical workload between patients monitored by telephone only (cohort 1) with those monitored via mobile app and telephone (cohort 2). […] In all, 56 patients were enrolled in the app-based virtual ward (cohort 2). […] Moreover, it translates to 3.30 fewer full-time equivalents (raw phone call data), resulting in 1.1 fewer full-time equivalents required to monitor 100 patients when adjusted for time spent reviewing app data.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, high hopes were put on digital contact tracing, using mobile phone apps to record and immediately notify contacts when a user reports as infected. […] Such apps can now be downloaded in many countries, but as second waves of COVID-19 are raging, these apps are playing a less important role than anticipated. […] We argue that this is because most countries have opted for app configurations that cannot provide a means of rapidly informing users of likely infections while avoiding too many false positive reports. […] Mathematical modelling suggests that differently configured apps have the potential to do this. […] When these points are understood, it becomes clear that we must rethink our approach to digital contact tracing in our fight against COVID-19.

[…] None of the apps tested were ideal for telemedicine, because some apps displayed accurate optotype size, while others displayed the same letters on separate devices; no apps exhibited both characteristics. […] Both Visual Acuity Charts and Kay iSight Test Professional had low mean (SD) errors and functionality across all tested devices, but no apps were suitable for telemedicine.

Targeted contact-tracing through mobile phone apps has been proposed as an instrument to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and manage the lifting of nation-wide lock-downs currently in place in USA and Europe. […] We built an expanded SIR model of COVID-19 epidemics that accounts for region-specific population densities, and we used it to test the impact of a contact-tracing app in a number of scenarios. […] Using demographic and mobility data from Italy and Spain, we used the model to simulate scenarios that vary in baseline contact rates, population densities, and fraction of app users in the population. […] Our results show that, in support of efficient isolation of symptomatic cases, app-mediated contact-tracing can successfully mitigate the epidemic even with a relatively small fraction of users, and even suppress altogether with a larger fraction of users. […] This work corroborates previous results in favor of app-mediated contact-tracing as mitigation measure for COVID-19, and draws attention on the importance of region-specific demographic and mobility factors to achieve maximum efficacy in containment policies.

Contact tracing apps are an essential component of an effective COVID-19 testing strategy to counteract the spread of the pandemic and thereby avoid overburdening the health care system. […] As the adoption rates in several regions are undesirable, governments must increase the acceptance of COVID-19 tracing apps in these times of uncertainty. […] Building on the Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT), this study aims to investigate how uncertainty reduction measures foster the adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps and how their use affects the perception of different risks. […] Representative survey data were gathered at two measurement points (before and after the app’s release) and analyzed by performing covariance-based structural equation modeling (n=1003). […] The use of the COVID-19 tracing app in turn reduced the perceived privacy and performance risks but did not reduce social risks and health-related COVID-19 concerns. […] Furthermore, our results help to derive communication strategies to promote the mass adoption of COVID-19 tracing apps, thus detecting infection chains and allowing intelligent COVID-19 testing.

[…] This study adopted a systematic search strategy to identify the free mobile applications available in the App and Google Play stores related to the COVID-19 outbreak. […] According to the PRISMA flowchart of the search, only 12 applications met the inclusion criterion. […] The 12 mobile applications that met the inclusion criterion were: Mawid, Tabaud, Tawakkalna, Sehha, Aarogya setu, TraceTogether, COVID safe, Immuni, COVID symptom study, COVID watch, NHS COVID-19, and PathCheck. […] The following features and functionalities of the apps were described: app overview (price, ratings, android, iOS, developer/owner, country, status), health tools (user status-risk assessment, self-assessment, E-pass integration, test results reporting, online consultation, contact tracing), learning options (personalized notes, educational resources, COVID-19 information), communication tools (query resolution, appointments, social network, notifications), app design (data visualization, program plan), networking tools (location mapping - GPS, connectivity with other devices), and safety and security options (alerts, data protection). […] Also, the effectiveness of the apps was analyzed. […] The analysis revealed that various applications have been developed for different functions like contact tracing, awareness building, appointment booking, online consultation, etc. […] However, only a few applications have integrated various functions and features such as self-assessment, consultation, support and access to information. […] Also, most of the apps are focused on contact tracing, while very few are dedicated to raising awareness and sharing information about the COVID-19 pandemic. […] Likewise, the majority of applications rely on GPS and Bluetooth technologies for relevant functions. […] No apps were identified that had built-in social media features. […] It is suggested to design and develop an integrated mobile health application with most of the features and functionalities analyzed in this study.

[…] The goal of this study was to analyze most of the COVID-19 contact tracing apps in use today. […] Beyond investigating the privacy features, design, and implications of these apps, this research examined the underlying technologies used in contact tracing apps. […] This research also investigated the data collection, reporting, retention, and destruction procedures used by each of the apps under review. […] This research study evaluated 13 apps corresponding to 10 countries based on the underlying technology used. […] The evaluated apps also included countries that did relatively well in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19, such as Singapore. […] Informational and unofficial contact tracing apps were excluded from this study. […] A total of 30,000 reviews corresponding to the 13 apps were scraped from app store webpages and analyzed. […] This study identified seven distinct technologies used by COVID-19 tracing apps and 13 distinct apps. […] The United States was reported to have released the most contact tracing apps, followed by Italy. […] Bluetooth was the most frequently used underlying technology, employed by seven apps, whereas three apps used GPS. […] The Norwegian, Singaporean, Georgian, and New Zealand apps were among those that collected the most personal information from users, whereas some apps, such as the Swiss app and the Italian (Immuni) app, did not collect any user information. […] The observed minimum amount of time implemented for most of the apps with regard to data destruction was 14 days, while the Georgian app retained records for 3 years. […] No significant battery drainage issue was reported for most of the apps. […] Interestingly, only about 2% of the reviewers expressed concerns about their privacy across all apps. […] The number and frequency of technical issues reported on the Apple App Store were significantly more than those reported on Google Play; the highest was with the New Zealand app, with 27% of the reviewers reporting technical difficulties (ie, 10% out of 27% scraped reviews reported that the app did not work). […] The Norwegian, Swiss, and US (PathCheck) apps had the least reported technical issues, sitting at just below 10%. […] In terms of usability, many apps, such as those from Singapore, Australia, and Switzerland, did not provide the users with an option to sign out from their apps. […] This article highlighted the fact that COVID-19 contact tracing apps are still facing many obstacles toward their widespread and public acceptance.

[…] From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. […] This study complements emerging survey data on public perceptions of digital contact tracing apps by providing a better understanding of the ideas circulating in the media ecosystem.

For this purpose, contact-tracing apps are being proposed for large scale adoption by many countries. […] A centralized approach, where data sensed by the app are all sent to a nation-wide server, raises concerns about citizens’ privacy and needlessly strong digital surveillance, thus alerting us to the need to minimize personal data collection and avoiding location tracking. […] We advocate the conceptual advantage of a decentralized approach, where both contact and location data are collected exclusively in individual citizens’ “personal data stores”, to be shared separately and selectively (e.g., with a backend system, but possibly also with other citizens), voluntarily, only when the citizen has tested positive for COVID-19, and with a privacy preserving level of granularity. […] This approach better protects the personal sphere of citizens and affords multiple benefits: it allows for detailed information gathering for infected people in a privacy-preserving fashion; and, in turn this enables both contact tracing, and, the early detection of outbreak hotspots on more finely-granulated geographic scale. […] The decentralized approach is also scalable to large populations, in that only the data of positive patients need be handled at a central level.

In order to share information and insight into the culture of our program with applicants, we created a smartphone app for those that were invited for an interview. […] By collecting the analytics of the app, we were able to follow trends in the timing of applicants downloading the app, their viewing histories, and when information was accessed. […] The app was mostly downloaded at the time of the interview invite or 48 h prior to the interview day. […] Around the interview day, applicants tended to access trainee profiles, faculty profiles, and videos about the program and community. […] This analysis from the use of a smartphone app in virtual recruitment gives insight into the use of a smartphone app by applicants, and the information that they find useful during the process.

In this letter, we describe the development of a mobile application that allows to simply measure power associated with mechanical ventilation, identifying each component (respiratory rate, resistance, driving pressure, PEEP volume) as well. […] Considering the potential role of medical apps to improve work efficiency, we developed an open source Progressive Web Application (PWA), named “PowerApp” (freely available at <a href="https://mechpower.goodbarber.app" class="uri">https://mechpower.goodbarber.app</a> ), in order to easily obtain a bedside measurement of mechanical power and its components. […] The “PowerApp” allows to measure mechanical power at a glance during mechanical ventilation, without complex mathematical computation, and making mechanical power equation useful and feasible for everyday clinical practice.

Many countries around the world have developed mobile phone apps capable of supporting instantaneous contact tracing to control the Covid-19 pandemic. […] In France, a few people have downloaded and are using the StopCovid contact tracing app. […] Exploring their usage and opinions about the app can inform improvements and diffusion of StopCovid among young people. […] To investigate health-related students’ knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices about the StopCovid app. […] A total of 77.3% (246/318) students had heard about the app, but only 11.3% (36/318) had downloaded it and 4.7% (15/318) were still using it at the time of the survey. […] Main reasons for not using the app were: belief that it was not effective given its limited diffusion (17.6%, 37/210), lack of interest (17.6%, 37/210) and distrust in data security and fear to be geo-located (15.7%, 33/210). […] Among those who had not heard about the app, after a brief description of its functioning and confidentiality policy, 52.7% (38/72) would use it. […] Participants reported that the main solution for increasing the use of the app would be a better communication (71.4%, 227/318). […] Even among health students the contact tracing app was poorly used.

It is intended to explore the available Apps for Spanish-speaking patients with Stroke for a specific sensory-motor rehabilitation process. […] A search of the available apps in Google Play and Apple Store was carried out using the keywords “Stroke”, “hemiplegia” and “hemiparesis”. […] The Apps detected have been described and evaluated by an anonymous survey among stroke survivors. […] Nine Apps have been identified and explored, four of which are available in Spanish: “NeuroRHB”, “Stroke Hope Health4TheWorld”, “9zest stroke recovery” and “Farmalarm”. […] Twelve survivors with stroke have participated in the anonymous survey evaluating with the best score the App “Farmalarm”. […] There are few specific Apps for the Stroke rehabilitation of sensory-motor impairments, and with important limitations that prevent their incorporation into clinical practice. […] The creation and adaptation of Apps for health professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists and their users are recommended. […] Telerehabilitation via App can be a solution, easily accessible by patients, to reduce healthcare inequality, intensify the rehabilitation process and provide continuity after discharge from the hospital.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, one way to reduce further transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 is the wide-spread use of contact-tracing apps. […] Such apps keep track of proximity contacts and warn contacts of cases that were tested positive for an infection. […] We analyze potential barriers to the large-scale adoption of the official contact-tracing app that was introduced in Germany on June 16, 2020. […] Survey data were collected from 3,276 adults during the week the app was introduced using an offline-recruited probability-based online panel of the general adult population in Germany. […] We estimate that 81% of the population aged 18-77 possess the devices and ability to install the official app and 35% are also willing to install and use it. […] Potential spreaders show high access (92%) and ability (91%) but low willingness (31%) of correct app adoption, whereas for vulnerable groups the main barrier is access (62%). […] The findings suggest a pessimistic view on the effectiveness of app-based contact-tracing to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. […] We recommend targeting information campaigns at groups with a high potential to spread the virus but unwilling to install and correctly use the app, in particular men and those aged between 30 and 59. […] In addition, vulnerable groups, in particular older individuals and those in lower-income households, may be provided with equipment and support to overcome their barriers to app adoption.
