Human pulmonary adenocarcinoma brain metastasis cell line PC-14/B were incubated and treated with constructed lentiviral plasmids expressing miR-217 and/or SIRT1.

[…] MiR-217 expression suppressed PC-14/B cell invasion (P=0.004), migration (P=0.001) and proliferation (P&lt;0.05), whereas SIRT1 overexpression reversed all processes.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, many healthcare systems are experiencing an increased demand for palliative care (PC). […] To meet this challenge, the PC team at Cleveland Clinic designed an enterprise-wide response plan organized around 4 domains: <i>staff</i> (educational resources and tools), <i>stuff</i> (medications and supplies), <i>space</i> (recommendations for optimizing physical space and facilities), and <i>systems</i> to facilitate high-quality PC delivery to patients.

The objective of this publicationis to provide recommendations in the management of prostate cancer (PC) in a new reality framework based on the presence of COVID-19 disease. […] The authors defined different priorities for the different clinical situations in PC. […] According to this classification, the working panel agreed on the distribution of the different diagnostic, therapeutic and follow-up scenarios for PC. […] The risk of severe morbidity as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection may out weigh the risk of PC morbidity/mortalityin many men; therefore, in the short term it is unlikely that delays in diagnosis or treatment can led to worse cancer outcomes.

In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic, new strategies are needed to address the unique and significant palliative care (PC) needs of patients with COVID-19 and their families, particularly when health systems are stressed by patient surges. […] Many PC teams rely on referral-based consultation methods that can result in needs going unidentified and/or unmet. […] Here we describe a novel system to proactively identify and meet the PC needs of all patients with COVID-19 being cared for in our hospital’s ICUs. […] Patients were screened through a combination of chart review and brief provider interview, and PC consultations were provided via telemedicine for those with unmet needs identified. […] In the first six weeks of operation, our pilot program of proactive screening and outreach resulted in PC consultation for 12 of the 29 (41%) adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19 at our institution. […] Consultations were most commonly for patient and family support as well as for goals of care and advance care planning, consistent with identified PC needs within this unique patient population.

[…] PC-MRI images were analyzed using custom software, providing: E’, E and A waves along with respective peak flow rates (Ef, Af, mL/s) and filling volume (mL), for both ventricles. […] RV diastolic function indices derived from PC-MRI data were reproducible (CoV ≤ 21%, ICC ≥ 0.75) and reliable as reflected by significant associations with left ventricular diastolic function indices assessed using both echocardiography (linear regression Pearson correlation coefficient r ≤ 0.59) and PC-MRI (r ≤ 71). […] Despite the fair associations between RV echocardiography and PC-MRI (r ≤ 0.25), the highest correlation with age was obtained for MRI Ef/Af ratio (r = - 0.64, p &lt; 0.0001 vs. r = - 0.40, p = 0.0001 for echocardiographic E/A). […] Among PC-MRI E/A ratios, highest correlations with age were observed for flow rate and mean velocity ratios (r = - 0.61, p &lt; 0.0001) as compared to maximal velocity ratios (r = - 0.56, p &lt; 0.0001). […] Associations with age for E’ were equivalent between PC-MRI (mean velocity: r = - 0.40, p &lt; 0.0001; maximal velocity: r = - 0.36, p = 0.0005) and echocardiography (r = - 0.36, p = 0.0006). […] Finally, the significant and age-independent associations between RV mass/end-diastolic volume and E’ were stronger for PC-MRI (mean velocity: r = - 0.36, p = 0.0006; maximal velocity: r = - 0.28, p = 0.007) than echocardiography (r = - 0.09, p = 0.38).
