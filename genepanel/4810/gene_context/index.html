[…] Congruent with the position that UK courts have adopted for resource allocation decision-making in the NHS more generally, specific requirements for a procedural framework and substantive triage criteria to be applied within that framework during the COVID-19 pandemic are considered in detail.

To compare National Health Service (NHS) organisations’ testing pathways for patients with suspected COVID-19 in the community versus standard hospital testing practices. […] NHS commissioners and services. […] We undertook a cost-minimisation analysis comparing the costs to the NHS in Wales of community testing for COVID-19 versus standard hospital testing practices and ambulance conveyancing. […] We analysed data from patients with suspected COVID-19 between January and February 2020 and applied assumptions of costs from national contractual and reference costs for ambulances, staffing and transportation with market costs at the time of publication. 177 patients with suspected COVID-19 underwent community testing via local NHS organisations between January and February 2020 with a mean age of 46.1 (IQR 27.5-56.3). […] We estimate, compared with standard hospital testing practices, cash savings in improved productivity for the NHS of £24,539 during this time period, in addition to further non-monetised benefits for hospital and ambulance flow. […] Community testing for COVID-19 in Wales is now an established pathway and continues to bring benefits for patients, local healthcare organisations and the NHS.

Intended as a contribution to the Waiting in Pandemic Times project Collection in response to COVID-19, this short theoretical paper views the coronavirus crisis in terms of its unpredictable effects on the interior life of the National Health Service (NHS) workforce. […] Written immediately following the suspension (due to the pandemic) of an ethnographic investigation of waiting in a general practice in London, it tracks the first signs that working definitions of time would struggle to survive the onset of a temporality of acute crisis in the NHS. […] The paper considers what it might mean for healthcare practitioners at this particular moment in the NHS’s history to be living through an experience of ‘the ordinary’ breaking down. […] It also follows hints of new temporal modes of care appearing during this same period when one kind of crisis in the NHS has been put on hold, and another (the crisis of coronavirus) is just getting underway.

Inform coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection prevention measures by identifying and assessing risk and possible vectors of infection in nursing homes (NHs) using a machine-learning approach. […] This retrospective cohort study used a gradient boosting algorithm to evaluate risk of COVID-19 infection (ie, presence of at least 1 confirmed COVID-19 resident) in NHs. […] The model was trained on outcomes from 1146 NHs in Massachusetts, Georgia, and New Jersey, reporting COVID-19 case data on April 20, 2020. […] Risk indices generated from the model using data from May 4 were prospectively validated against outcomes reported on May 11 from 1021 NHs in California.

Older people living in nursing homes (NHs) are particularly vulnerable in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, due to the high prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities (e.g., dementia). […] The phenomenon of adverse events (AEs), intended as any harm or injury resulting from medical care or to the failure to provide care, has not yet been investigated in NHs during the pandemic. […] We performed a national survey on 3,292 NHs, either public or providing services both privately and within the national health system, out of the 3,417 NHs covering the whole Italian territory. […] The list of NHs was provided by the Dementia Observatory, an online map of Italian services for people with dementia, which was one of the objectives of the implementation of the Italian National Dementia Plan. […] About 26% of residents in the Italian NHs for older people listed within the Dementia Observatory site had dementia. […] The objective of our study was to report the frequency of AEs that occurred during the months when SARS-CoV-2 spreading rate was at its highest in the Italian NHs and to identify which conditions and attributes were most associated with the occurrence of AEs by means of multivariate regression logistic analysis. […] Data are referred to 1,356 NHs that participated in the survey.

National Health Service (NHS) field hospitals are part of a capacity building response built at great scale and speed to respond to the anticipated increased demand the NHS faces during this time. […] NHS Nightingale Hospital Birmingham (NHB) is modelled to treat mild to moderate (non-critical care) COVID-19 disease, to provide step-down capacity for patients in recovery, or for palliating patients in the dying phase of their disease in the Midlands. […] Opportunities and challenges presented for optimal medicines management (MM) during the development of the NHB are investigated, and a framework developed to support future NHS field hospitals of this model. […] A team, comprised of an associate medical director, trust chief pharmacist and senior pharmacists iteratively developed a framework to convert the large non-hospital setting into a functioning NHS field hospital with standardised MM processes adjusted appropriately to cope with operational constraints in the pandemic situation. […] MM processes are extensive and integral to NHS field hospitals. […] The presented framework of influencing factors may support future NHS field hospital development.

[…] We further validated the final model in held-out data from an additional NHS region (London). 74 944 participants (recruited between Feb 6 and Aug 26, 2020) were included, of whom 31 924 (43·2%) of 73 948 with available outcomes met the composite clinical deterioration outcome. […] In internal-external cross-validation in the development cohort of 66 705 participants, the selected model (comprising 11 predictors routinely measured at the point of hospital admission) showed consistent discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility across all eight NHS regions.

They have garnered great interest regarding their potential benefit to limit Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections due to fewer people living, working, visiting, and being admitted to Green House/small NHs, and private rooms and bathrooms, but this assumption has not been tested. […] If they prove advantageous compared with other NHs, they may constitute an especially promising model as policy makers and providers reinvent NHs post-COVID. […] This cohort study compared rates of COVID-19 infections, COVID-19 admissions/readmissions, and COVID-19 mortality, among Green House/small NHs with rates in other NHs between January 20, 2020 and July 31, 2020. […] All Green House homes that held a skilled nursing license and received Medicaid or Medicare payment were invited to participate; other small NHs that replicate Green House physical design and operational practices were eligible if they had the same licensure and payer sources. […] Of 57 organizations, 43 (75%) provided complete data, which included 219 NHs. […] Comparison NHs (referred to as “traditional NHs”) were up to 5 most geographically proximate NHs within 100 miles that had &lt;50 beds and ≥50 beds for which data were available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). […] A log-rank test compared rates between Green House/small NHs and traditional NHs with &lt;50 beds and ≥50 beds. […] Rates of all outcomes were significantly lower in Green House/small NHs than in traditional NHs that had &lt;50 beds and ≥50 beds (log-rank test P &lt; .025 for all comparisons). […] The median (middle value) rates of COVID-19 cases per 1000 resident days were 0 in both Green House/small NHs and NHs &lt;50 beds, while they were 0.06 in NHs ≥50 beds; in terms of COVID-19 mortality, the median rates per 100 positive residents were 0 (Green House/small NHs), 10 (&lt;50 beds), and 12.5 (≥50 beds). […] Differences were most marked in the highest quartile: 25% of Green House/small NHs had COVID-19 case rates per 1000 resident days higher than 0.08, with the corresponding figures for other NHs being 0.15 (&lt;50 beds) and 0.74 (≥50 beds). […] COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates are less in Green House/small NHs than rates in traditional NHs with &lt;50 and ≥50 beds, especially among the higher and extreme values. […] Green House/small NHs are a promising model of care as NHs are reinvented post-COVID.
