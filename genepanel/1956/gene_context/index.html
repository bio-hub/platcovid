Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between eGFR on admission and the mortality rate of COVID-19. […] On admission, eGFR was calculated using the CKD-EPI formula. […] Binary logistic regression and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between eGFR on admission and in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. […] Baseline eGFR was under 60 mL/min/1.73m2 in 61 patients (18.2%). […] Age-adjusted and multivariate logistic regression analysis (p: 0.005, odds ratio: 0.974, CI: 0.956-0.992) showed that baseline eGFR was independently associated with mortality. […] Additionally, age-adjusted Cox regression analysis revealed a higher mortality rate in patients with an eGFR under 60 mL/min/1.73m2. […] On admission eGFR seems to be a prognostic marker for mortality in patients with COVID-19. […] We recommend that eGFR be measured in all patients on admission and used as an additional tool for risk stratification. […] Close follow-up should be warranted in patients with a reduced eGFR.

We describe here a sensitive and quantitative flow cytometry method using the cytometer-friendly non-adherent Jurkat T-cell line that stably expresses the full-length native spike “S” protein of SARS-CoV-2 and a truncated form of the human EGFR that serves a normalizing role. […] S protein and huEGFRt coding sequences are separated by a T2A self-cleaving sequence, allowing to accurately quantify the presence of anti-S immunoglobulins by calculating a score based on the ratio of fluorescence intensities obtained by double-staining with the test sera and anti-EGFR.

Males were significantly higher in PP, ICU, and NP groups, from 2 to 4-fold higher than females, while in the NN group, the number of females was mildly higher than males; the PP patients showed a marked alkalotic, hypoxic, hypocapnia ABG profile with hyperventilation at the time of admission; finally, the laboratory and microbiology results showed lymphopenia, fibrinogen, ESR, CRP, and eGFR were markedly anomalous.

Secondary endpoints : The key secondary endpoints are the individual components of the primary components and include the following: death, transfer to ICU primarily for invasive ventilation, transfer to ICU for other indication, non-fatal MACE ( any of following, MI, stroke, acute HF, new onset Afib), length of stay &gt; 4 days, development of acute kidney injury ( &gt; 40% decline in eGFR or doubling of serum creatinine), urgent intravenous treatment for high blood pressure, 30% increase in baseline high sensitivity troponin, 30% increase in baseline BNP, increase in CRP to &gt; 30% in 48 hours and lymphocyte count drop&gt; 30%.

Multivariate logistic regression showed age (RC 1.101; 95% CI 1.026 - 1.181; p = 0.0070), estimated glomerular filtration rate - eGFR (RC 1.127; 95% CI 1.022 - 1.243; p = 0.0170) and hypertension (RC 3.212; 95% CI 1.065 - 9.690; p = 0.0380) as independent predictors of AKI. […] We found a high incidence of AKI; and as predictive factors for its occurrence: age, eGFR and hypertension.
