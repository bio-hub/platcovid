Two coronavirus receptor proteins, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 (DPP4) are also established transducers of metabolic signals and pathways regulating inflammation, renal and cardiovascular physiology, and glucose homeostasis. […] Moreover, glucose-lowering agents such as the DPP4 inhibitors, widely used in subjects with T2D, are known to modify the biological activities of multiple immunomodulatory substrates. […] Here we review the basic and clinical science spanning the intersections of diabetes, coronavirus infections, ACE2, and DPP4 biology, highlighting clinical relevance and evolving areas of uncertainty underlying the pathophysiology and treatment of T2D in the context of coronavirus infection.

It has been hypothesized that DPP4 inhibition, a therapy currently available for type 2 diabetes, might represent a target for decreasing the risk of the acute respiratory complications of the COVID-19 infection but (1) lack of demonstration of SARS-CoV2 binding to DPP4 (2) possible protective role of sDPP4 in Middle East respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) (3) demonstrated inhibition and downregulation of DPP4 by HIV1 and MERS-CoV and (4) not exclusive role of the receptor binding in tropism of the Coronavirus family, support that DPP4 inhibition at present doesn’t represent a plausible approach to mitigate COVID-19.

Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as cluster of differentiation 26 (CD26), is a serine exopeptidase expressed ubiquitously in several tissues, including but not limited to lung, kidney, liver, gut, and immune cells. […] The question has been raised on whether DPP4 modulation or inhibition may prevent infection and/or progression of the COVID-19. […] A docked complex model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and DPP4 has been proposed, showing a large interface between the proteins and proposing close similarity with other coronaviruses using DPP4 as functional receptor. […] Nevertheless, this observation may rise the question on whether DPP4 is directly involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell adhesion/virulence, and whether DPP4 inhibition might be a therapeutic strategy for preventing infection. […] Although a direct involvement of DPP4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be clarified, there is also evidence suggesting that DPP4i modulate inflammation and exert anti-fibrotic activity. […] Taken together these findings may suggest a potential role for DPP4 inhibition or modulation in one or more steps of COVID-19 immunopathogenesis.

In the case of MERS-CoV, S proteins bind to the host cell receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) which is broadly expressed on intestinal, alveolar, renal, hepatic and prostate cells as well as on activated leukocytes [8]. […] In the case of MERSCoV, its RBM binds to DPP4 with residues 484-567, thus, suggesting that its RBD differs from that of SARS-CoV [12, 13].

Cell binding and entry of betacoronaviruses is via their surface spike glycoprotein; SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2. […] DPP4 is a ubiquitous membrane-bound aminopeptidase that circulates in plasma; it is multifunctional with roles in nutrition, metabolism, and immune and endocrine systems. […] DPP4 activity differentially regulates glucose homeostasis and inflammation via its enzymatic activity and nonenzymatic immunomodulatory effects. […] The importance of DPP4 for the medical community has been highlighted by the approval of DPP4 inhibitors, or gliptins, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. […] This review discusses the dysregulation of DPP4 in COVID-19 comorbid conditions; DPP4 activity is higher in older individuals and increased plasma DPP4 is a predictor of the onset of metabolic syndrome. […] DPP4 upregulation may be a determinant of COVID-19 disease severity, which creates interest regarding the use of gliptins in management of COVID-19. […] Also, knowledge of the chemistry and biology of DPP4 could be utilized to develop novel therapies to block viral entry of some betacoronaviruses, potentially including SARS-CoV-2.

Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. […] Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 are identical to those that are bound to the MERS-CoV-S. […] Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with SARS-CoV-S. […] This potential utilization of DPP4 as a binding target for SARS-CoV-2 may offer novel insight into the viral pathogenesis and help the surveillance and therapeutics strategy for meeting the challenge of COVID-19.

Virus binds to the cell surface receptor ACE2; indeed, recent evidences suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may be using as co-receptor, when entering the cells, the same one used by MERS-Co-V, namely the DPP4/CD26 receptor. […] The aforementioned observation underlined that mechanism of cell entry is supposedly similar among different coronavirus, that the co-expression of ACE2 and DPP4/CD26 could identify those cells targeted by different human coronaviruses and that clinical complications may be similar. […] The DPP4 family/system was implicated in various physiological processes and diseases of the immune system, and DPP4/CD26 is variously expressed on epithelia and endothelia of the systemic vasculature, lung, kidney, small intestine and heart. […] In particular, DPP4 distribution in the human respiratory tract may facilitate the entrance of the virus into the airway tract itself and could contribute to the development of cytokine storm and immunopathology in causing fatal COVID-19 pneumonia. […] The use of DPP4 inhibitors, such as gliptins, in patients with COVID-19 with, or even without, type 2 diabetes, may offer a simple way to reduce the virus entry and replication into the airways and to hamper the sustained cytokine storm and inflammation within the lung in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.

The 3D homologous modelling was performed by SWISS-MODEL to establish mutated S protein structural model, in which the protein-docking was then implemented with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and aminopeptidase N (APN) by ZDOCK, and the combining capacity of each mutated S protein evaluated by FiPD. […] Protein-receptor docking analysis between naturally mutated S protein and host receptors showed that, in the case of spontaneous mutation, the binding ability of S protein to ACE2 tended to be weakened, while the binding ability of DPP4 tended to be enhanced, and there was no significant change in the binding ability of APN. […] The mutated SARS-CoV-2 might tend to target human cells with DPP4 as a new receptor rather than keep ACE2 as its unique receptor for human infection.

In this study, we investigated the variability of four genes (ACE2, ANPEP and DPP4 encoding for host receptors of the viral spike proteins and TMPRSS2 encoding for a host proteinase) in 23 European (19 autochthonous and three commercial breeds and one wild boar population) and two Asian Sus scrofa populations.

Here, we review the role of antidiabetic agents, mainly including insulin, metformin, pioglitazone, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in DM patients with coronavirus infection, addressing the clinical therapeutic choices for these subjects.
