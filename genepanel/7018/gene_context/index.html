Total flavonoids (TF), the main active components derived from loquat leaves, showed remarkable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. […] The results demonstrated that TF suppressed the histological changes in the lungs of CS-challenged mice, as evidenced by reduced generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), nitric oxide (NO), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and diminished the protein expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1). […] Moreover, TF also inhibited phosphorylation of IKK, IκB and NFκB and increased p-Akt. […] Interestingly, TF could inhibit CS-induced oxidative stress in the lungs of COPD mice. […] TF treatment significantly inhibited the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). […] In addition, TF markedly downregulated TRPV1 and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and upregulated the expression of SOD-2, while the p-JNK level was observed to be inhibited in COPD mice. […] Taken together, our findings showed that the protective effect and putative mechanism of the action of TF resulted in the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress through the regulation of TRPV1 and the related signal pathway in lung tissues. […] It suggested that TF derived from loquat leaves could be considered to be an alternative or a new functional material and used for the treatment of CS-induced COPD.

In our further analysis of MVI we showed MVI serve as binding sites for a single transcription factor (TF) family, EXPREG, involved in the regulatory mode of these genes. […] From EXPREG family four TFs that belongs to Cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) and Catabolite control protein A (CcpA) group mostly serve as transcriptional activator whereas two TFs that belong to LexA group always serve as transcriptional repressor in different kinds of cellular processes and molecular functions.

Both TNF-α and AT-II have been implicated in promoting overexpression of tissue factor (TF) in platelets and macrophages. […] Additionally, the generation of antiphospholipid antibodies associated with COVID-19 may also promote an increase in TF. […] TF may be a critical mediator associated with the development of thrombotic phenomena in COVID-19, and should be a target for future study.

Various proinflammatory stimuli can promote thrombosis by inducing luminal endothelial expression of tissue factor (TF), which interacts with circulating coagulation factor VII to trigger extrinsic coagulation. […] The signalling mechanism whereby these stimuli evoke TF expression entails activation of NADPH oxidase, upstream from activation of the NF-kappaB transcription factor that drives the induced transcription of the TF gene. […] It is therefore proposed that SARS-CoV-2 infection of endothelial cells evokes the expression of TF which is contingent on endosomal NADPH oxidase activation.

It is not yet clear whether IV infusion is a safe and effective route of MSC delivery in COVID-19, since MSC-based products express variable levels of highly procoagulant tissue factor (TF/CD142), compromising the cells’ hemocompatibility and safety profile. […] Of concern, IV infusions of poorly characterized MSC products with unchecked (high) TF/CD142 expression could trigger blood clotting in COVID-19 and other vulnerable patient populations and further promote the risk for thromboembolism.

Currently, transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TF-TAVI) is predominantly performed as an elective catheterisation laboratory (cath lab) procedure. […] Our study population comprised 90 patients treated with TF-TAVI, with local analgesia performed by our dedicated cath lab nurses. […] The performance of TF-TAVI using local analgesia only, managed by a dedicated nurse instead of an anaesthesiologist, was shown to be feasible and safe in a selected group of patients.

In our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, platelet-monocyte interaction was strongly associated with tissue factor (TF) expression by the monocytes. […] Platelet activation and monocyte TF expression were associated with markers of coagulation exacerbation as fibrinogen and D-dimers, and were increased in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or patients who evolved with in-hospital mortality. […] Finally, platelets from severe COVID-19 patients were able to induce TF expression ex vivo in monocytes from healthy volunteers, a phenomenon that was inhibited by platelet P-selectin neutralization or integrin αIIb/β3 blocking with the aggregation inhibitor abciximab. […] Altogether, these data shed light on new pathological mechanisms involving platelet activation and platelet-dependent monocyte TF expression, which were associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.

Coagulopathy and inflammation are interconnected by the transmembrane receptor, tissue factor (TF), which initiates blood clotting as a cofactor for factor VIIa (FVIIa)-mediated factor Xa (FXa) generation. […] TF also functions from within the nascent TF/FVIIa/FXa complex to trigger profound changes via protease-activated receptors (PARs) in many cell types, including SARS-CoV-2-trophic cells. […] Therefore, aberrant expression of TF may be the underlying basis of COVID-19 symptoms. […] Since numerous cell types express TF and can act as sites for virus replication, a model envelope virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), has been used to investigate the uptake of TF into the envelope. […] Indeed, HSV1 and other viruses harbor surface TF antigen, which retains clotting and PAR signaling function. […] Strikingly, envelope TF is essential for HSV1 infection in mice, and the FXa-directed oral anticoagulant apixaban had remarkable antiviral efficacy. […] SARS-CoV-2 replicates in TF-bearing epithelial and endothelial cells and may stimulate and integrate host cell TF, like HSV1 and other known coagulopathic viruses. […] Combined with this possibility, the features of COVID-19 suggest that it is a TFopathy, and the TF/FVIIa/FXa complex is a feasible therapeutic target.

Increased plasma levels of NETs, tissue factor (TF) activity, and sC5b-9 were detected in patients. […] Neutrophils of patients yielded high TF expression and released NETs carrying active TF. […] Treatment of control neutrophils with COVID-19 platelet-rich plasma generated TF-bearing NETs that induced thrombotic activity of HAECs. […] Complement C3 inhibition with compstatin Cp40 disrupted TF expression in neutrophils.

Herein, we report on in silico comparative analysis between complete genome of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 strains, to identify the occurrence of specific conserved motifs on viral genomic sequences which should be able to bind and therefore induce a subtraction of host’s Transcription Factors (TFs) which lead to a depletion, an effect comparable to haploinsufficiency (a genetic dominant condition in which a single copy of wild-type allele at a locus, in heterozygous combination with a variant allele, is insufficient to produce the correct quantity of transcript and, therefore, of protein, for a correct standard phenotypic expression). […] In this competitive scenario, virus versus host, the proposed in silico protocol identified the TFs same as the distribution of TFBSs (Transcription Factor Binding Sites) on analyzed viral strains, potentially able to influence genes and pathways with biological functions confirming that this approach could brings useful insights regarding SARS-CoV-2. […] According to our results obtained by this in silico approach it is possible to hypothesize that TF-binding motifs could be of help in the explanation of the complex and heterogeneous clinical presentation in SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently predict possible interactions regarding metabolic pathways, and drug or target relationships.

We hypothesized that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 leads to induction of TF (tissue factor) expression and increased levels of circulating TF-positive extracellular vesicles (EV) that may drive thrombosis. […] Approach and Results: We measured levels of plasma EV TF activity in 100 patients with COVID-19 with moderate and severe disease and 28 healthy controls. […] Levels of EV TF activity were significantly higher in patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. […] In addition, levels of EV TF activity were associated with disease severity and mortality. […] Finally, levels of EV TF activity correlated with several plasma markers, including D-dimer, which has been shown to be associated with thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. […] Our results indicate that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection induces the release of TF-positive EVs into the circulation that are likely to contribute to thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. […] EV TF activity was also associated with severity and mortality.

Notably, the activation of the coagulation cascade occurs through tissue factor (TF)/FVIIa-initiated hemostasis. […] Accordingly, TF plays the major role in the activation of coagulation system during viral infection. […] In viral infections, the related coagulopathy multiple factors such as inflammatory cytokines and viral specific TLRs are involved, which consequently induce TF expression aberrantly. […] In addition, TF expression/release from these cells may play a critical role in the development of COVID-19 coagulopathy. […] In this regard, the use of TF- VIIa complex inhibitor may reduce the cytokine storm and mortality among COVID-19 patients.

In addition, the damage to endothelial cells after viral infection and/or activation of endothelium by pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-8, and TNF-α induces platelets and monocyte aggregation in the vascular wall and expression of tissue factor (TF). […] The TF expression may culminate in the formation of thrombi, and activation of cascade by the extrinsic pathway by association with factor VII.

Because tissue factor (TF) conveyed by extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been implicated in thrombosis, we quantified the EV-TF activity in a cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 111) and evaluated its link with inflammation, disease severity, and thrombotic events. […] The EV-TF activity was notably increased in patients with severe COVID-19 compared with that observed in patients with moderate COVID-19 (median, 231 [25th to 75th percentile, 39-761] vs median, 25 [25th to 75th percentile, 12-59] fM; P &lt; .0001); EV-TF was correlated with leukocytes, D-dimer, and inflammation parameters. […] High EV-TF values were associated with an increased thrombotic risk in multivariable models. […] Compared with patients who had septic shock, those with COVID-19 were characterized by a distinct coagulopathy profile with significantly higher EV-TF and EV-fibrinolytic activities that were not counterbalanced by an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). […] Thus, this article is the first to describe the dissemination of extreme levels of EV-TF in patients with severe COVID-19, which supports the international recommendations of systematic preventive anticoagulation in hospitalized patients and potential intensification of anticoagulation in patients with severe disease.
