We assessed markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation, including von Willebrand Factor (VWF) antigen, soluble thrombomodulin, soluble P-selectin, and soluble CD40 ligand, as well as coagulation factors, endogenous anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic enzymes. […] Markers of endothelial cell and platelet activation were significantly elevated in ICU patients compared with non-ICU patients, including VWF antigen (mean 565% [SD 199] in ICU patients vs 278% [133] in non-ICU patients; p&lt;0·0001) and soluble P-selectin (15·9 ng/mL [4·8] vs 11·2 ng/mL [3·1]; p=0·0014). […] VWF antigen concentrations were also elevated above the normal range in 16 (80%) of 20 non-ICU patients. […] We found mortality to be significantly correlated with VWF antigen (r = 0·38; p=0·0022) and soluble thrombomodulin (r = 0·38; p=0·0078) among all patients.

Even if much more data are needed to ascertain the real thrombotic risk of haemophilia A in COVID-19 patients, it’s clear that the FVIII and vWF should be strictly monitored in order to promptly establish an adequate treatment and avoid the onset of thromboembolic events, even fatal, causing many deaths in COVID-19 patients.

Clinical observations have also highlighted that these patients have elevated von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIIIc. 24 consecutive COVID-19 positive patients were selected from the intensive care unit (ICU) or the high acuity ward of Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust. […] Factor VIIIc and von vWF antigen levels were both extremely elevated at 279 (148) u/dL and 350 (131) % respectively, which are comparable to levels seen in ICU patients with severe sepsis. vWF levels were significantly higher in patients that died (p=0.017) and showed a positive correlation with age. […] Very high levels of vWF and factor VIIIc are common in COVID-19 patients, comparable to levels in severely septic non-COVID ICU patients. […] Further studies are needed to evaluate the use of vWF for stratifying thrombotic risk in COVID-19 and to determine if elevated vWF is contributing to disease pathogenesis.

Of particular interest are the various circulating inflammatory coagulation biomarkers involved directly in clotting, with specific focus on fibrin(ogen), D-dimer, P-selectin and von Willebrand Factor (VWF). […] Most significant is that patients need to be treated early in the disease progression, when high levels of VWF, P-selectin and fibrinogen are present, with normal or slightly increased levels of D-dimer (however, D-dimer levels will rapidly increase as the disease progresses). […] Progression to VWF and fibrinogen depletion with high D-dimer levels and even higher P-selectin levels, followed by the cytokine storm, will be indicative of a poor prognosis.

Cumulative findings of microvascular thrombosis has raised question if the endothelium and microvasculature should be a point of investigative focus. von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its protease, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), play important role in the maintenance of microvascular hemostasis. […] In inflammatory conditions, imbalanced VWF-ADAMTS-13 characterized by elevated VWF levels and inhibited and/or reduced activity of ADAMTS-13 has been reported. […] Also, an imbalance between ADAMTS-13 activity and VWF antigen is associated with organ dysfunction and death in patients with systemic inflammation. […] A thorough understanding of VWF-ADAMTS-13 interactions during early and advanced phases of COVID-19 could help better define the pathophysiology, guide thromboprophylaxis and treatment, and improve clinical prognosis.

It is long established that von Willebrand factor (VWF) is central to hemostasis and thrombosis. […] Endothelial VWF is stored in cell-specific secretory granules, Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), organelles generated in a wide range of lengths (0.5-5.0 µm). […] WPB size responds to physiological cues and pharmacological treatment, and VWF secretion from shortened WPBs dramatically reduces platelet and plasma VWF adhesion to an endothelial surface. […] In vitro assays of two selected compounds confirm that they inhibit the pro-hemostatic activity of secreted VWF.

We assessed whether coagulation biomarkers, including FVIII and VWF levels, measured at time of admission were predictive of COVID-19 adverse outcomes irrespective of age and major comorbidities associated with metabolic syndrome. […] Blood was sampled at admission in 243 adult COVID-19 patients for analysis of coagulation biomarkers including FVIII and VWF on platelet-poor plasma. […] The association between baseline CRP, aPTT ratio, PT ratio, D-dimers, fibrinogen, FVIII, VWF:Ag and FVIII/VWF:Ag ratio levels and adverse outcomes (increased oxygen requirements, thrombosis and death at day-30) was assessed by regression analysis after adjustment on age, sex, body mass index, diabetes and hypertension. […] In univariable regression analysis increased CRP (SHR, 1.68; 95%CI, 1.26 to 2.23), increased fibrinogen (SHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.68) and decreased FVIII/VWF:Ag ratio (SHR, 0.70 ; 95% CI, 0.52-0.96) levels at admission were significantly associated with the risk of increased oxygen requirement during follow-up.

We thank Bhogal and colleagues for their positive comments on our manuscript and their perspective on VWF being a potential driver of COVID-19 microvascular thrombosis rather than a mere biomarker of endotheliopathy. […] It is well-known that VWF promotes neutrophil recruitment to endothelial surfaces under low-shear conditions and supports neutrophil extravasation towards inflamed tissues1 . […] This pro-inflammatory role of VWF involves two distinct pathways: (1) a direct interaction of neutrophil receptors (PSGL1 and β2-integrins) with VWF, and (2) an indirect interaction in which neutrophils adhere to VWF-bound platelets.

Moreover, as smoking increases the blood circulatory level of VWF and decreases the levels of thrombomodulin, it can lead to dysregulated blood homeostasis and hence, increased risk of thrombosis which significantly increases the risk of stroke and cardiovascular disorders.

[…] Their SC5b-9 levels correlated with those of vWF (r = 0.517, p = 0.0001) and paralleled disease severity (severe vs mild p = 0.0001, severe vs moderate p = 0.026 and moderate vs mild p = 0.001). […] After 30 days, plasma SC5b-9, C5a and vWF levels had significantly decreased (p = 0.0001 for all), and 43% of the evaluated patients had normal levels.

We assessed von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF ristocetin-cofactor (VWF:RCo), VWF multimers, VWF propeptide (VWFpp), and ADAMTS13 activity in a cross-sectional study of 50 patients stratified according to their admission to three different intensity of care units: low (requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation, n = 14), intermediate (requiring continuous positive airway pressure devices, n = 17), and high (requiring mechanical ventilation, n = 19). […] Median VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, and VWFpp levels were markedly elevated in COVID-19 patients and increased with intensity of care, with VWF:Ag being 268, 386, and 476 IU/dL; VWF:RCo 216, 334, and 388 IU/dL; and VWFpp 156, 172, and 192 IU/dL in patients at low, intermediate, and high intensity of care, respectively. […] Conversely, the high-to-low molecular-weight VWF multimers ratios progressively decreased with increasing intensity of care, as well as median ADAMTS13 activity levels, which ranged from 82 IU/dL for patients at low intensity of care to 62 and 55 IU/dL for those at intermediate and high intensity of care. […] We found a significant alteration of the VWF-ADAMTS13 axis in COVID-19 patients, with an elevated VWF:Ag to ADAMTS13 activity ratio that was strongly associated with disease severity.

In this investigation, we aimed to evaluate ADAMTS13 activity, von Willebrand factor level (VWF:Ag), and the corresponding ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio, in patients with COVID-19 and for associations with disease progression and acute kidney injury (AKI). […] ADAMTS13 activity and VWF:Ag were measured at index ED visit. […] Overall, we observed that 23.1% of the cohort had a relative deficiency in ADAMTS13 activity, while 80.8% had elevated VWF:Ag. […] The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was significantly lower in patients with severe AKI (P = .002) and those who developed the severe form of COVID-19 (P = .020). […] The ADAMTS13 activity/VWF:Ag ratio was negatively correlated with age (P &lt; .001) and LDH (P &lt; .001), while positively correlated with hemoglobin (P = .041). […] After controlling for confounders, a one-unit increase in ADAMTS13/VWF:Ag ratio was associated with 20% decreased odds of severe AKI. […] A low ADAMTS13 activity:VWF:Ag ratio at ED presentation is associated with progression to severe COVID-19 disease and severe AKI, with a pattern suggestive of a secondary microangiopathy. […] Further interventional studies should be conducted to assess the restoration of ADAMTS13:VWF:Ag ratio in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

Consistent with EC activation, increased plasma von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) levels have been reported in COVID-19. […] Importantly however, studies in other microangiopathies have shown that plasma VWF propeptide (VWFpp) is a more sensitive and specific measure of acute EC activation. […] Markedly increased plasma VWF:Ag [median (interquatile range, IQR) 608·8 (531-830)iu/dl] and pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII) levels [median (IQR) 261·9 (170-315) iu/dl] were seen in patients with severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. […] Sequential testing showed that these elevated VWF-FVIII complex levels remained high for up to 3 weeks. […] Similarly, plasma VWFpp levels were also markedly elevated [median (IQR) 324·6 (267-524) iu/dl]. […] Interestingly however, the VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio was reduced, demonstrating that decreased VWF clearance contributes to the elevated plasma VWF:Ag levels in severe COVID-19. […] Importantly, plasma VWFpp levels also correlated with clinical severity indices including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Sepsis-Induced Coagulopathy (SIC) score and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (P/F ratio). […] Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that sustained fulminant EC activation is occurring in severe COVID-19, and further suggest that VWFpp may have a role as a biomarker in this setting.

Both neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and von Willebrand factor (VWF) are essential for thrombosis and inflammation. […] During these processes, a complex series of events, including endothelial activation, NET formation, VWF secretion, and blood cell adhesion, aggregation and activation, occurs in an ordered manner in the vasculature. […] The adhesive activity of VWF multimers is regulated by a specific metalloprotease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 13). […] Increasing evidence indicates that the interaction between NETs and VWF contributes to arterial and venous thrombosis as well as inflammation. […] In addition, the levels of VWF and ADAMTS13 can predict the mortality of COVID-19. […] In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics and interactions of NETs, VWF, and ADAMTS13, and discuss their roles in TMAs, AIS, and COVID-19. […] Targeting the NET-VWF axis may be a novel therapeutic strategy for inflammation-associated TMAs, AIS, and COVID-19.

We measured total levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and vWF binding to the platelet glycoprotein (Gp) complex (GPIb-IX-V), in a cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit of our Institution. […] We found that levels of vWF antigen and the active form of vWF binding to platelets (vWF:RCo), were markedly increased in these patients. […] These results were associated with higher agglutination rates induced by ristocetin, thereby indirectly indicating an increased capability of vWF to bind to platelets. […] This study shows that COVID-19 is associated with increased vWF-induced platelet agglutination but reduced platelet responsivity to aggregation stimuli. […] Our findings have translational relevance since platelet adhesion to vWF may represent a marker to predict possible complications and better delineate therapeutic strategies in COVID-19 patients.

A panel of endothelial biomarkers and von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers were measured in each patient ≤ 48 h following admission. […] However, only von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) scaled according to clinical severity, with levels significantly higher in critical patients (median 507%, IQR 428-596) compared to non-critical patients (288%, 230-350, p &lt; 0.0001) or COVID-19 outpatients (144%, 133-198, p = 0.007). […] Moreover, VWF high molecular weight multimers (HMWM) were significantly higher in critical patients (median ratio 1.18, IQR 0.86-1.09) compared to non-critical patients (0.96, 1.04-1.39, p &lt; 0.001). […] Among all endothelial biomarkers measured, ROC curve analysis identified a VWF:Ag cut-off of 423% as the best predictor for in-hospital mortality. […] The accuracy of VWF:Ag was further confirmed in a Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis and a Cox proportional Hazard model adjusted on age, BMI, C-reactive protein and D-dimer levels. […] VWF:Ag is a relevant predictive factor for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Autopsies of hyperferritinemic patients that succumbed to either sepsis, HLH, MAS or COVID-19 have revealed disseminated microvascular thromboses with von Willebrand factor (VWF)-, platelets-, and/or fibrin-rich microthrombi. […] Here, we show that secretion of VWF from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is significantly enhanced by 100,000 ng/ml of recombinant ferritin heavy chain protein (FHC). […] Ferritin fraction that was isolated by size exclusion chromatography from the plasma of critically ill HLH patients promoted VWF secretion from HUVEC, compared to similar fraction from non-critically ill control plasma. […] Furthermore, recombinant FHC moderately suppressed the activity of VWF cleaving metalloprotease ADAMTS-13. […] These observations suggest that a state of marked hyperferritinemia could promote thrombosis and organ injury by inducing endothelial VWF secretion and reducing the ADAMTS-13 activity.
