Favipiravir is an antiviral previously indicated for influenza and Ebola, which has shown some promise in early trials for treatment of COVID-19. […] We aim to review existing favipiravir safety evidence, which is vital to informing the potential future use of favipiravir in COVID-19. […] All studies assessing the use of favipiravir in humans by 27 March 2020 were considered for inclusion. […] Twenty-nine studies were identified as potential sources of evidence of the clinical safety of favipiravir. […] The proportions of grade 1-4 AEs on favipiravir was 28.2% <i>vs</i> 28.4% (<i>P</i> = n.s.) in the comparison arms. […] The proportion of discontinuations due to AEs on favipiravir was 1.1% <i>vs</i> 1.2% (<i>P</i> = n.s.) in the comparison arms. […] There were significantly fewer gastrointestinal AEs occurring on favipiravir <i>vs</i> comparators [8.7% <i>vs</i> 11.5%; <i>P</i> = 0.003]. […] Favipiravir showed significantly more uric acid elevations than comparators [5.8% <i>vs</i> 1.3%; <i>P</i>&lt;0.0001]. […] Favipiravir demonstrates a favourable safety profile regarding total and serious AEs. […] Favipiravir may be safe and tolerable in short-term use, but more evidence is needed to assess the longer-term effects of treatment. […] Given the limitations of the evidence and unresolved safety concerns, caution is warranted in the widespread use of favipiravir against pandemic COVID-19.

In light of the recent pandemic, favipiravir (Avigan<sup>®</sup>), a purine nucleic acid analog and antiviral agent approved for use in influenza in Japan, is being studied for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] Increase in blood uric acid level is a frequent side effect of favipiravir. […] Here, we discussed the mechanism of blood uric acid elevation during favipiravir treatment. […] Favipiravir is metabolized to an inactive metabolite M1 by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, and excreted into urine. […] Favipiravir and M1 act as moderate inhibitors of organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3), which are involved in uric acid excretion in the kidney. […] Thus, favipiravir is thought to decrease uric acid excretion into urine, resulting in elevation of uric acid levels in blood. […] Elevated uric acid levels were returned to normal after discontinuation of favipiravir, and favipiravir is not used for long periods of time for the treatment of viral infection. […] Nevertheless, the adverse effect of favipiravir might be clinically important in patients with a history of gout, hyperuricemia, kidney function impairment (in which blood concentration of M1 increases), and where there is concomitant use of other drugs affecting blood uric acid elevation.

The goal of this study was to locate small molecules to be used against COVID19 instead of favipiravir. […] Favipiravir analogues were selected as drug candidates from the PubChem web tool. […] The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein was selected as the target protein as favipiravir inhibits this protein in the human body. […] Then, the inhibition properties of selected drug candidates and favipiravir were examined in detail against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp proteins. […] It was found that 2-oxo-1H-pyrazine-3-carboxamide performed better than favipiravir in the results of molecular docking, molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PSBA) calculations, and ADME analyses.

By multiple logistic regression analysis, receiving favipiravir was associated with nasopharyngeal viral load reduction at three days (P=0.001). […] Significant nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 viral load reduction was achieved in the COVID-19 patients who received favipiravir-containing regimen.

Nucleoside analogs, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs by targeting the viral polymerases. […] Here, we reveal that Favipiravir, as a pyrazine derivative, could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. […] We further determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. […] This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues that may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides.

The RNA polymerase inhibitor favipiravir is currently in clinical trials as a treatment for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite limited information about the molecular basis for its activity. […] Here we report the structure of favipiravir ribonucleoside triphosphate (favipiravir-RTP) in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) bound to a template:primer RNA duplex, determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) to a resolution of 2.5 Å. […] The structure reveals an unusual, nonproductive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which explains its low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand.

Recently several drugs have been used as anti-SARS-CoV-2 such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Nafamostat mesylate and so on. […] Remdesivir and Favipiravir were more promising despite having side effects; it had prominent efficacy and efficiency while still not yet approved as the official anti-viral drug for SARS CoV-2.

On the 13th day after the start of favipiravir administration, the patient developed a fever with a temperature of 38.1°C. […] Since he was in good overall health and no concomitant symptoms and signs were apparent, we considered it to be drug fever due to favipiravir.
