[…] In the epithelial cells, the enzyme superoxide dismutase catalyzes a reaction leading from hydrogen peroxide to the ion superoxide.

[…] The hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse led to no significant reduction of intraoral viral load. […] A 1% hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse does not reduce the intraoral viral load in SARS-CoV-2-positive subjects.

Hydrogen has been shown to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hormone-regulating, and apoptosis-resistance properties, among others. […] Based on a review of the research, the use of hydrogen might reduce the destructive cytokine storm and lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 during COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) in the early stage, stimulating ropy sputum drainage, and ultimately reducing the incidence of severe disease. […] Molecular hydrogen treatment has the potential to become a new adjuvant therapy for COVID-19, but its efficacy and safety require large clinical trials and further confirmation.

NBO analysis confirms the presence of two strong stable hydrogen bonded NH⋯O intermolecular interactions and two weak hydrogen bonded CH⋯O interactions. […] The red shift in NH stretching frequency exposed from IR substantiates the formation of NH⋯O intermolecular hydrogen bond and the blue shift in CH stretching frequency substantiates the formation of CH⋯O intermolecular hydrogen bond.

The recorded hydrogen bonds were recognized in the strongest range of H Bond category distances. […] Identification of binding site interactions revealed that the interaction of Zn(QC)Cl2(H2O)with the protease of COVID-19 results in three hydrogen bonds, while Zn(HQC)Cl2(H2O) exhibited a strong binding to the main protease receptor by forming eight hydrogen bonds.

The docking analysis of CPT against the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 showed hydrogen bonding with the amino acids at K466 with a bond distance of 2.56A° and K355 with a bond distance of 2.40A°. […] This finding was of particular importance that other compounds including hydroxychloroquine sulphate, lopinavir and ivermectin could bind with the spike protein only by weak Vander wall bonds and no hydrogen bond formation was noticed.
