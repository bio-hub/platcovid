Anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, has been used subcutaneously and intravenously in pediatric patients and is considered a first-line treatment for MAS and secondary HLH (sHLH) among many pediatric rheumatologists. […] Previous reports of anakinra used in adults for treatment of MAS or sHLH are limited to subcutaneous administration. […] In this issue, Moneagudo et al. present a series of adult patients with sHLH treated with intravenous anakinra, including patients in whom subcutaneous anakinra was insufficient. […] As the authors suggest, there is a potential therapeutic use for anakinra in sHLH or the cytokine storm syndrome triggered by COVID19.

To report the benefit of a therapeutic approach consisting of intravenous continuous anakinra (recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) infusions in treating severely ill adult patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis/macrophage activation syndrome (sHLH/MAS). […] Continuous IV anakinra infusions up to 2400 mg/day resulted in rapid serologic, then clinical response in 4/5 severely ill patients who were refractory to all other therapies including subcutaneous anakinra. […] Subsequently, 3/5 have been maintained on anakinra or canakinumab with no recurrence of MAS. […] Continuous infusion of IV anakinra may result in rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with MAS.

Anakinra is a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist that might be beneficial in this patient population. […] We compared survival, mechanical ventilation-free survival, changes in C-reactive protein, respiratory function, and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with anakinra (either 5 mg/kg twice a day intravenously [high dose] or 100 mg twice a day subcutaneously [low dose]) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive anakinra (referred to as the standard treatment group). […] Between March 17 and March 27, 2020, 29 patients received high-dose intravenous anakinra, non-invasive ventilation, and standard treatment. […] A further seven patients received low-dose subcutaneous anakinra in addition to non-invasive ventilation and standard treatment; however, anakinra treatment was interrupted after 7 days because of a paucity of effects on serum C-reactive protein and clinical status. […] At 21 days, treatment with high-dose anakinra was associated with reductions in serum C-reactive protein and progressive improvements in respiratory function in 21 (72%) of 29 patients; five (17%) patients were on mechanical ventilation and three (10%) died. […] At 21 days, survival was 90% in the high-dose anakinra group and 56% in the standard treatment group (p=0·009). […] Mechanical ventilation-free survival was 72% in the anakinra group versus 50% in the standard treatment group (p=0·15). […] Bacteraemia occurred in four (14%) of 29 patients receiving high-dose anakinra and two (13%) of 16 patients receiving standard treatment. […] Discontinuation of anakinra was not followed by inflammatory relapses. […] In this retrospective cohort study of patients with COVID-19 and ARDS managed with non-invasive ventilation outside of the ICU, treatment with high-dose anakinra was safe and associated with clinical improvement in 72% of patients.

To report the clinical experience with anakinra for preventing mechanical ventilation (MV) in patients with COVID-19, features of cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), and acute hypoxic respiratory failure (AHRF).

[…] Seven of those who initiated anakinra ≤36 hours after onset of AHRF did not require MV, and all were discharged home. […] Four patients who started anakinra ≥4 days after onset of AHRF required MV. […] All 3 patients who met criteria but did not receive anakinra required MV.

In both conditions, clinicians may be doubtful regarding the safety of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, colchicine, and biological agents, such as anti-IL1 agents (e.g. anakinra), that are the mainstay of therapy for pericarditis.For NSAIDs, there is no clear scientific evidence linking ibuprofen and other NSAIDs to worsening of COVID-19; however, it seems prudent to continue them, if necessary to control pericarditis, and on the other hand, to prefer paracetamol for fever and systemic symptoms related to COVID-19. […] Treatments with corticosteroids, colchicine, and anakinra appear well tolerated in the context of COVID-19 infection and are currently actively evaluated as potential therapeutic options for COVID infection at different stages of the disease. […] On this basis, currently most treatments for pericarditis do not appear contraindicated also in the presence of possible COVID-19 infection and should not be discontinued, and some (corticosteroids, colchicine, and anakinra) can be considered to treat both conditions.

It has been postulated that anakinra, a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, might help to neutralise the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related hyperinflammatory state, which is considered to be one cause of acute respiratory distress among patients with COVID-19. […] We aimed to assess the off-label use of anakinra in patients who were admitted to hospital for severe forms of COVID-19 with symptoms indicative of worsening respiratory function. […] Patients in the anakinra group were treated with subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg twice a day for 72 h, then 100 mg daily for 7 days) as well as the standard treatments at the institution at the time. […] The main analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis (including all patients in the anakinra group who received at least one injection of anakinra). […] From March 24 to April 6, 2020, 52 consecutive patients were included in the anakinra group and 44 historical patients were identified in the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint-Joseph COVID cohort study. […] Admission to the ICU for invasive mechanical ventilation or death occurred in 13 (25%) patients in the anakinra group and 32 (73%) patients in the historical group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·22 [95% CI 0·11-0·41; p&lt;0·0001). […] The treatment effect of anakinra remained significant in the multivariate analysis (HR 0·22 [95% CI 0·10-0·49]; p=0·0002). […] An increase in liver aminotransferases occurred in seven (13%) patients in the anakinra group and four (9%) patients in the historical group.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of anakinra in patients who were admitted to hospital for severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy. […] Patients in the interventional arm received subcutaneous anakinra (100 mg twice daily for 3 days, followed by 100 mg daily for 7 days) in addition to standard treatment. […] A total of 69 patients were included: 45 treated with anakinra and 24 historical controls. […] A need for mechanical ventilation occurred in 14 (31%) of the anakinra-treated group and 18 (75%) of the historical cohort (p &lt; 0.001). […] In-hospital death occurred in 13 (29%) of the anakinra-treated group and 11 (46%) of the historical cohort (p = 0.082). […] Successful weaning from supplemental oxygen to ambient air was attained in 25 (63%) of the anakinra-treated group compared with 6 (27%) of the historical cohort (p = 0.008).

Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, is known to be effective in several hyperinflammatory diseases. […] We investigated the effects of anakinra on inflammatory parameters and clinical outcomes in critically ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with clinical features of hyperinflammation. […] In this prospective cohort study, 21 critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with anakinra were compared to a group of standard care. […] Serial data of clinical inflammatory parameters and concentrations of multiple circulating cytokines were determined and aligned on start day of anakinra in the treatment group, and median start day of anakinra in the control group. […] Additionally, three sensitivity analyses were performed: (1) using propensity score-matched groups, (2) selecting patients who did not receive corticosteroids, and (3) using a subset of the control group aimed to match the criteria (fever, elevated ferritin) for starting anakinra treatment. […] As a consequence of bias by indication, plasma levels of aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) (p = 0.0002), ferritin (p = 0.009), and temperature (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the anakinra group on alignment day. […] Decreases of clinical parameters, including temperature (p = 0.03), white blood cell counts (p = 0.02), and plasma levels of ferritin (p = 0.003), procalcitonin (p = 0.001), creatinine (p = 0.01), and bilirubin (p = 0.007), were more pronounced in the anakinra group.
