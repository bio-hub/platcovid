Using data on sample of N = 55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 7th, 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter) or ozone. […] In particular, hinterland cities with average high number of days exceeding the limits set for PM<sub>10</sub> (and also having a low wind speed) have a very high number of infected people on 7th April 2020 (arithmetic mean is about 2200 infected individuals, with average polluted days greater than 80 days per year), whereas coastal cities also having days exceeding the limits set for PM<sub>10</sub> or ozone but with high wind speed have about 944.70 average infected individuals, with about 60 average polluted days per year; moreover, cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM<sub>10</sub>), they have a very high average number of infected people (about 3350 infected individuals, 7th April 2020), whereas cities having less than 100 days of air pollution per year, they have a lower average number of infected people (about 1014 individuals). […] The findings here also suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year that Italian provincial capitals or similar industrialized cities can exceed the limits set for PM<sub>10</sub> or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, is about 48 days.

[…] The results from these analyses showed that daily average temperature, daily maximum eight-hour ozone concentration, average relative humidity, and cloud percentages were significantly and positively associated with new confirmed cases related to COVID-19; none of these variables showed significant associations with new deaths related to COVID-19. […] The findings indicate that short-term exposures to ozone and other meteorological factors can influence COVID-19 transmission and initiation of the disease, but disease aggravation and mortality depend on other factors.

The COVID-19 lockdown presented a peculiar opportunity to study a shift in the photochemical regime of ozone production in Quito (Ecuador) before and after mobility restrictions. […] Primary precursors such as NO and CO dropped dramatically as early as 13 March 2020, due to school closures, but ambient ozone did not change. […] In this work we use a chemical box model in order to estimate regimes of ozone production before and after the lockdown. […] We constrain the model with observations in Quito (ozone, NOx, CO, and meteorology) and with estimations of traffic-associated VOCs that are tightly linked to CO. […] With reduced NOx in the morning rush hour (lockdown conditions), ozone production rates at 08:30-10:30 increased from 4.2 to 17 to 9.7-23 ppbv h-1, respectively. […] To test further the observed shift in chemical regime, ozone production was recalculated with post-lockdown NOx levels, but setting VOCs to pre-lockdown conditions. […] This change tripled ozone production rates in the mid-morning and stayed higher throughout the day. […] In light of these findings, practical scenarios that present the potential for ozone accumulation in the ambient air are discussed.

[…] In Europe, ozone responses are more sensitive to emission declines in other continents, international shipping and aviation than to emissions changes within Europe.

The main objective of this narrative review is to describe the available evidence on the possible antiviral activity of ozone in patients with COVID-19 and its therapeutic applicability through hospital protocols. […] Amongst different possible therapies for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, ozone therapy seems to have an immunological role because of the modulation of cytokines and interferons, including the induction of gamma interferon. […] Some data suggest the possible role of ozone therapy in SARS, either as a monotherapy or, more realistically, as an adjunct to standard treatment regimens; therefore, there is increasing interest in the role of ozone therapy in COVID-19 treatment The PubMed and Scopus databases and the Italian Scientific Society of Oxygen Ozone Therapy website were used to identify articles focused on ozone therapy. […] Of 280 articles found on ozone therapy, 13 were selected and narratively reviewed. […] Ozone exerts antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral replication and direct inactivation of viruses. […] Ozone is an antiviral drug enhancer and is not an alternative to antiviral drugs. […] Combined treatment with involving ozone and antivirals demonstrated a reduction in inflammation and lung damage. […] The routes of ozone administration are direct intravenous, major autohaemotherapy and extravascular blood oxygenation-ozonation. […] Systemic ozone therapy seems useful in controlling inflammation, stimulating immunity and as antiviral activity and providing protection from acute coronary syndromes and ischaemia reperfusion damage, thus suggesting a new methodology of immune therapy. […] Systemic ozone therapy in combination with antivirals in COVID-19-positive patients may be justified, helpful and synergic.

We found that: (i) Interactome-based infection pathways differ from the other three omics-based profiles. (ii) Viral process, mRNA splicing, cytokine and interferon signaling, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis are important pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infection. (iii) SARS-CoV-2 infection also shares pathways with Influenza A, Epstein-Barr virus, HTLV-I, Measles, and Hepatitis virus. (iv) Further, bacterial, parasitic, and protozoan infection pathways such as Tuberculosis, Malaria, and Leishmaniasis are also shared by this virus. (v) A total of 50 candidate drugs, including the prophylaxis agents and pathway specific inhibitors are identified against COVID-19. (vi) Betamethasone, Estrogen, Simvastatin, Hydrocortisone, Tositumomab, Cyclosporin A etc. are among the important drugs. (vii) Ozone, Nitric oxide, plasma components, and photosensitizer drugs are also identified as possible therapeutic candidates. (viii) Curcumin, Retinoic acids, Vitamin D, Arsenic, Copper, and Zinc may be the candidate prophylaxis agents.

The new SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 emergency has imposed new disinfection and sanitation measures of work environments also to beauty and health professional workers and in this context ozone shows growing interest. […] Ozone has proven to be highly effective in killing bacteria, fungi, and molds and inactivating viruses both on the surfaces and suspended in the air. […] Ozone is proven to be effective also for the inactivation of the SARS virus, while for the novel SARS-CoV-2 it is supposed that it be equally effective but specific studies are needed.

For instance, the use of ozone gas as a safe and potent disinfectant against SARS-CoV-2 virus is of particular interest. […] Here we tested the use of pseudoviruses as a model for evaluating ozone disinfection of the coronavirus at ozone concentrations of 30, 100, and 1000 ppmv. […] Results show that ozone disinfection rate of pseudoviruses was similar to that of coronavirus 229E (HuCoV-229E) at short contact times, below 30 min. […] Viral infection decreased by 95% following ozone exposure for 20 min at 1000 ppmv, 30 min at 100 ppmv and about 40 min at 30 ppmv. […] This findings mean that ozone is a powerful disinfectant toward the enveloped pseudovirus even at low ozone exposure. […] Infected surfaces made of aluminum alloy, for example, were better disinfected with ozone as compared to brass, copper, and nickel surfaces. […] Lastly, we demonstrate the advantage of ozone over liquid disinfectants by showing similar viral disinfection on top, side, bottom, and interior surfaces.
