[…] On the other hand, the number of new cases was 24.6 per 1 million people on March 27, 2020, in Turkey.

[…] In all, 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure about getting themselves vaccinated for a COVID-19 vaccine. […] Also, 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus.

The same questionnaire was disseminated in both Italy and Turkey during their respective lockdown phases. 140,000 interviews were collected in Italy and 10,000 in Turkey, a number big enough to obtain useful information for a comparative analysis in relation to behaviours, attitudes and well-being, also using the recursive regression models. […] The results, based on scientific data, show that gender stereotypes are much more rooted in Turkey than in Italy, where the emancipation process of the population is more advanced, producing profound social changes and decreasing differences between men and women in terms of behaviour and reactions to difficult situations, such as the present one.

[…] Even though these two countries have similar political and ideological approaches and are roughly the same size in terms of population density, as well as despite a high number of reported COVID-19 cases, a fast infection spread rate, and mismanagement of the crisis in both countries, Turkey’s death toll remained lower when compared to the death toll in Iran. […] Deploying a comparative case study methodology drawing on an analysis of secondary sources, this study investigates Turkey and Iran’s official responses to COVID-19 to further understand authoritarian reactions to large-scale crises and how distinctions between the actions taken by authoritarian regimes might impact crisis management in such contexts.

[…] It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. […] The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered, and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. […] Additionally, sections devoted to control optimal and others dedicated to compare cases between Turkey and South Africa with the aim to comprehend why there are less numbers of deaths and infected people in South Africa than Turkey were presented in detail.
