Tocilizumab, which is the IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), is expected to treat cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 and is now in clinical trials. […] In this paper, we will elaborate the role of cytokine storm in COVID-19, the mechanism of tocilizumab on cytokine storm and the key points of pharmaceutical care based on the actual clinical application for COVID-19 in our hospital, the latest research reports, clinical trial progress of tocilizumab, drug instruction from the US FDA, and “Diagnosis and Treatment Plan of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (seventh trial edition)” in China, so as to provide reference for the treatment of COVID-19.

Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6R) is FDA-approved for treatment of cytokine storm associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. […] Here we examined compassionate use of tocilizumab in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. […] We report on a single-center study of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. […] We examined clinical and laboratory parameters including oxygen and vasopressor requirements, cytokine profiles, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels pre- and post-tocilizumab treatment. […] Twenty seven SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients received one 400 mg dose of tocilizumab. […] IL-6 was the predominant cytokine detected at tocilizumab treatment. […] Significant reductions in temperature and CRP were seen post-tocilizumab. […] Oxygen and vasopressor requirements diminished over the first week post-tocilizumab. […] Adverse events and serious adverse events were minimal, but two deaths (7.4%) occurred that were felt unrelated to tocilizumab. […] Compared to published reports on the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2, tocilizumab appears to offer benefits in reducing inflammation, oxygen requirements, vasopressor support, and mortality. […] The rationale for tocilizumab treatment is supported by detection of IL-6 in pathogenic levels in all patients. […] Additional doses of tocilizumab may be needed for those showing slow declines in CRP.

Several studies show that the immunosuppressive drugs targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, including tocilizumab, ameliorate lethal inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

[…] Furthermore, although tocilizumab treatment attenuates the inflammation, immune cells, including plasma B cells and CD8+ T cells, still exhibit robust humoral and cellular antiviral immune responses. […] Thus, in addition to providing a high-dimensional dataset on the immune cell distribution at multiple stages of the COVID-19, our work also provides insights into the therapeutic effects of tocilizumab, and identifies potential target cell populations for treating COVID-19-related cytokine storms.

To describe the first Australian cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) disease (COVID-19) pneumonia treated with the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab. […] Five adult male patients aged between 46 and 74 years with type 1 respiratory failure due to COVID-19 pneumonia requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and biochemical evidence of systemic hyperinflammation (C-reactive protein greater than 100 mg/L; ferritin greater than 700 μg/L) were administered variable-dose tocilizumab. […] Four adverse events potentially associated with tocilizumab therapy occurred in three patients: ventilator-associated pneumonia, bacteremia associated with central venous catheterization, myositis and hepatitis. […] The time from first tocilizumab administration to improvement in ventilation, defined as a 25% reduction in fraction of inspired oxygen required to maintain peripheral oxygen saturation greater than 92%, ranged from 7 hours to 4.6 days. […] Tocilizumab use was associated with favorable clinical outcome in our patients. […] We recommend tocilizumab be included in randomized controlled trials of treatment for patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and be considered for compassionate use in such patients pending the results of these trials.

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 monoclonal receptor antibody, has been used in some centers for mitigating the severe inflammatory response seen in patients with severe COVID-19 with encouraging results. […] To the best of our knowledge, reports detailing the outcomes of patients with severe COVID-19 undergoing treatment with tocilizumab are sparse in sub-Saharan Africa. […] We describe the clinical and laboratory profile, chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan findings and clinical outcome in a Ghanaian patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia treated with tocilizumab. […] He was treated with a single 400mg dose of intravenous tocilizumab with a positive clinical outcome, rapid decline in CRP and improvement in chest CT findings.

[…] All patients were treated using the institution’s treatment algorithm, which included consideration of tocilizumab for severe and critical disease. […] The most common cytokine elevations among all patients included IL-6, sIL2R, IFN-γ, and IL-10; patients who received tocilizumab had higher incidence of IL-6 and sIL2R elevations. […] Pre-tocilizumab IL-6 levels increased with disease severity (p = .0151). […] Both IL-6 and sIL2R levels significantly increased after administration of tocilizumab in all severity groups; IL-10 levels decreased in severe (p = .0203), but not moderate or critical, patients after they received tocilizumab. […] Mean IL-6, sIL2R, and D-dimer were associated with mortality, and tocilizumab-treated patients with elevated IL-6, IL-10, and D-dimer were more likely to also receive glucocorticoids. […] The increase in sIL2R post-tocilizumab, despite administration of glucocorticoids, may indicate the need for combination therapy in order to modulate more than one hyperinflammatory pathway in COVID-19.

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were available for the following drugs: hydroxychloroquine (n=12), glucocorticoids (n=6), tocilizumab (n=4), convalescent plasma (n=4), interferon beta (n=2), intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) (n=2) and n=1 each for anakinra, baricitinib, colchicine, leflunomide, ruxolitinib, interferon kappa and vilobelimab. […] Glucocorticoids were able to reduce mortality in specific subsets of patients, while conflicting data were available about tocilizumab.

A subgroup of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is considered to develop a cytokine release syndrome and have been treated with tocilizumab, but a significant percentage of patients evolve. […] Our objective was to determine the usefulness of anakinra as rescue treatment for patients with tocilizumab-refractory COVID-19 disease. […] A prospective cohort of patients with COVID19 pneumonia who received anakinra as salvage therapy after failure of tocilizumab were compared (1:1) to selected controls in a historical cohort of patients treated with tocilizumab. […] Cases and controls were matched by age, comorbidities, pulse oximetry oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio at baseline and time elapsed since the initiation of treatment with tocilizumab. […] Treatment with anakinra was not useful to improve the prognosis of patients with tocilizumab-refractory severe COVID-19.

Left ventricular ejection fraction and strain improved 7 days after the initial echocardiogram, after administration of Tocilizumab, coinciding with clinical recovery, and improvement in inflammatory markers.
