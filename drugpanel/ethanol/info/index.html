The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to 9 days, but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within 1 minute.

We collected clinical blood samples from voriconazole-treated patients in heparinized tubes and sterilized the surface of the tubes with 75% ethanol. […] Heat inactivation of the samples was carried out at 56 ℃ for 30 min followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile or ethanol. […] Sample preparation with acetonitrile or ethanol resulted in a high mean recovery (100.56% or 95.90%) with minimal mean matrix effect (102.85% or 93.62%). […] Heat inactivation at 56 ℃ for 30 min combined with ethanol sample preparation only has limited effects to affect LC-MS-based voriconazole concentration measurement in whole blood samples collected in heparinized tubes, and can be used for therapeutic drug monitoring of voriconazole during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam that contains ethanol or isopropanol used to disinfect hands. […] If soap and water are not readily available, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products that contain at least 60% ethyl alcohol (ethanol) or 70% isopropyl alcohol (isopropanol) in community settings (1); in health care settings, CDC recommendations specify that alcohol-based hand sanitizer products should contain 60%-95% alcohol (≥60% ethanol or ≥70% isopropanol) (2). […] Cases of ethanol toxicity following ingestion of alcohol-based hand sanitizer products have been reported in persons with alcohol use disorder (3,4). […] Whereas early clinical effects of methanol and ethanol poisoning are similar (e.g., headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and decreased level of consciousness), persons with methanol poisoning might develop severe anion-gap metabolic acidosis, seizures, and blindness.

The use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) based on a low-cost portable instrument for monitoring the quality of the three major formulations of ethanol-based hand sanitizers used for prevention against CoVID-19 disease is described. […] In the second, a quantitative method was designed to determine the active substance (ethanol) employing multivariate regression based on partial least squares. […] The results demonstrate that the first approach can be used to detect non-conformities in the sanitizer composition, mostly associated with incorrect ethanol content. […] The second explores the use of NIRS for determination of the ethanol content in the three formulations aiming the quality control of the sanitizer manufacturing process. […] The ethanol content can be determined with an absolute root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) equal to 0.68% (m/m), 0.83% (m/m) and 1.0% (v/v) for the three formulations evaluated. […] Besides, NIRS was employed to compare the rate of volatilization of the ethanol in the different formulations, an important parameter concerning the efficacy of ethanol-based sanitizers.
