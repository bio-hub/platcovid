We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. […] Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.9 (95%CI: 0.9,1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5).

To date, assays based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory samples are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. […] To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results. […] We can conclude that: (1) rapid diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are necessary, but should be adequately sensitive and specific; (2) few studies have been carried out to date; (3) the studies included are characterized by low numbers and low sample power, and (4) in light of these results, the use of available tests is currently questionable for clinical purposes and cannot substitute other more reliable molecular tests, such as assays based on RT-PCR.

Classical definition of myocarditis, supported by endomyocardial biopsy of inflammatory infiltrate, is rare; it has been observed in only one case report to date, and the virus has not been identified inside cardiomyocytes.Thus, the phenomenon that has been documented is acute myocardial injury, making it necessary to rule our obstructive coronary disease based on increased markers of myocardial necrosis, whether or not they are associated with ventricular dysfunction, likely associated with cytokine storms and other factors that may synergistically promote myocardial injury, such as sympathetic hyperactivation, hypoxemia, arterial hypotension, and microvascular thrombotic phenomena.Systemic inflammatory and myocardial phenomena following viral infection have been well documented, and they may progress to cardiac remodeling and myocardial dysfunction.

Two estimation methods of ICU_ALOS were compared: the average LOS of already discharged patients at the date of estimation (DPE), and a standard parametric method used for analyzing time-to-event data which fits a given distribution to observed data and includes the censored stays of patients still treated in the ICU at the date of estimation (CPE). […] At the last follow-up date, 99 days after the first admission, all patients but one had been discharged. […] CPE and DPE estimates were also compared to COVID-19 estimates reported to date. […] Series’ true ICU_ALOS was greater than 21 days, well above reported estimates to date. […] Cautious unbiased ICU_ALOS estimates suggest parameterizing a higher burden of ICU bed occupancy than that adopted to date in COVID-19 forecasting models.

In this article we assess the impact of missteps by the Federal Government in three specific areas: the introduction of the virus to the US and the establishment of community transmission; the lack of national COVID-19 workplace standards and enforcement, and lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for workplaces as represented by complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) which we find are correlated with deaths 16 days later (ρ = 0.83); and the total excess deaths in 2020 to date already total more than 230,000, while COVID-19 mortality rates exhibit severe-and rising-inequities in race/ethnicity, including among working age adults.

The RDt index does not take into account the time of infection, but the date of the diagnosis of positivity and for this reason it is defined as diagnostic replication index, as it aims to describe the intensity of the development of frequency for cases recognized as positive in the population.The comparison between different possible applications of the methods and the use of different types of monitoring data was limited to four areas for which complete individual data were available in March and April 2020. […] The main problems in the use of Rt, which is based on the date of symptoms onset, arise from the lack of completeness of this information due both to the difficulty in the recording and to the absence in asymptomatic subjects.The general trend of RDt, at least at an intermediate lag of 6 or 7 days, is very similar to that of Rt, as confirmed by the very high value of the correlation index between the two indices.

Yet, to date, there is no evidence of this disproportionate impact on non-national individuals, including economic migrants, short-term travellers and refugees. […] We found that, compared to Italian cases, non-Italian cases were diagnosed at a later date and were more likely to be hospitalized {[adjusted rate ratio (ARR)=1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.33-1.44]} and admitted to ICU (ARR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.07-1.32), with differences being more pronounced in those coming from countries with lower human development index (HDI).

The study proves no correlation between the country surge date and the 2 weeks preceding temperature or humidity but shows an impressive linear correlation with latitude. […] The country surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below ≈ 34% of that of 0° latitude. […] The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit of being triggered only by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. decreases in the sun UV daily dose.

This present review aims to comprehensively summarize the up-to-date scientific literatures on biological activities of plant- and mushroom-derived compounds relevant to mechanistic targets involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection and inflammatory-associated pathogenesis, including viral entry, replication and release, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). studies were excluded. molecular docking analysis, herein, we provide a total of 150 natural compounds as potential candidates for development of new anti-COVID-19 drugs with higher efficacy and lower toxicity than the existing therapeutic agents.

To date, about half of antivirals have been created based on nucleosides. […] To date, two known nucleoside drugs (Ribavirin, Favipiravir) have been recommended for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and nine hit compounds based on nucleosides and their analogues have been found, one of which efficiently suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication and eight others inhibiting SARS-CoV replication.
