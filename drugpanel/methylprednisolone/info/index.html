In most cases, application of methylprednisolone in severe and critical viral pneumonia patients can quickly alleviate the symptoms of dyspnea and prevent disease progression. […] In our retrospective non-randomised study, 34 patients under 50 years old and diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were included, according to given methylprednisolone treatment (n = 18) or not (n = 16), they were separated into 2 groups.

There are no determined treatment agents for the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); therefore, it is suggested that methylprednisolone, as an immunosuppressive treatment, can reduce the inflammation of the respiratory system. […] The patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio by block randomisation method to receive standard care with methylprednisolone pulse (intravenous injection, 250 mg·day-1 for 3 days) or standard care alone. […] Patients with clinical improvement were higher in the methylprednisolone group than in the standard care group (94·1% versus 57·1%), and the mortality rate was numerically lower in the methylprednisolone group (5·9% versus 42.9%; p &lt;0·001). […] We demonstrated that patients in the methylprednisolone intervention group had a significantly increased survival time compared with the patients in the standard care group [Log rank test: p&lt;0.001; Hazard ratio: 0.293; 95% C‎‎I: 0.‎154-0.556].

Data on the effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 remain limited. […] The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID-19 disease were evaluated. […] The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID-19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P &lt; .001; OR: 0.054 95% CI: 0.017-0.173). […] Among patients with severe COVID-19 aged &lt; 65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42.2% vs 90.0%, P = .000) and the mortality(6.7% vs 30.0%, P = .002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non-methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non-methylprednisolone group were found among patients with COVID-19 older than 65 years. […] Data from the limited sample showed that the early use of low or medium doses of methylprednisolone has a positive effect for patients with severe COVID-19 younger than 65 years old, and excessive immune response and cytokine storm may be some of the reasons for the effectiveness.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in treating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. […] Among them, 255 patients were treated using methylprednisolone, and 188 did not receive any corticosteroid-related treatment. […] Patients without the use of methylprednisolone were more quickly to obtain negative results of their nasopharyngeal swab tests of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid after treatment, compared to those receiving methylprednisolone. […] Methylprednisolone could not improve the prognosis of patients with COVID-19, and the efficacy and safety of the use of methylprednisolone in patients with COVID-19 still remain uncertain, thus the use of corticosteroids clinically in patients with COVID-19 should be with cautions.

[…] Totally 75 COVID-19 patients admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 22, 2020 to February 29, 2020 were recruited and grouped based on whether or not LPV/r and ARB were jointly used and whether or not Methylprednisolone was used. […] While for severe and critically severe patients, Methylprednisolone noticeably reduced the time for negative conversion. […] Meanwhile, the clinical efficacy was superior on patients receiving Methylprednisolone within 3 days upon admission, and the duration of hospital stays was much shorter when Methylprednisolone was given at a total dose of 0-400 mg than a higher dose of &gt;400 mg if all patients received a similar dose per day. […] Additionally, Methylprednisolone was efficient in severe and critically severe cases, and superior efficacy could be realized upon its early, appropriate and short-term application.

Our working hypothesis is that methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus may be an effective and safety drug combination for treating severe COVID-19 patients. and analysis: TACROVID is a randomized, open-label, single-center, phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone pulses and tacrolimus plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone, in patients at advanced stage of COVID-19 disease with lung injury and systemic hyperinflammatory response. […] Methylprednisolone and tacrolimus might be beneficial to treat those COVID-19 patients progressing into severe pulmonary failure and systemic hyperinflammatory syndrome. […] The rationale for its use is the fast effect of methylprednisolone pulses and the ability of tacrolimus to inhibit both the CoV-2 replication and the secondary cytokine storm.
