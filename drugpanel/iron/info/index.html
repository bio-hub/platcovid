Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. […] Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. […] Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. […] For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. […] Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). […] The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. […] For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.

Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. […] Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. […] Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. […] These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation. […] Both retrospective analyses of data in electronic health records, as well as proof of concept studies in humans and large RCTs are needed to fully elucidate the efficacy and safety of iron chelating agents in the therapeutic armamentarium of COVID-19, probably as an adjunctive treatment.

Intravenous iron is the first-line treatment in subjects with moderate-severe anemia, active disease, or oral iron intolerance. […] On the other hand, oral iron is recommended in patients with mild anemia and inactive disease. […] However, during the current coronavirus pandemic, hospital activities have significantly changed, and all non-essential procedures, including non-urgent iron infusions, have been rescheduled. […] Oral iron, including both the traditional formulations with ferrous iron and the new ferric iron complexes, could constitute a valid alternative for anemia treatment. […] For this reason, we conducted a literature review, to summarize the scientific evidence on oral iron therapy in IBD patients with anemia.

A hemoglobinopathy, hypoxia and cell iron overload might have a possible additional role. […] In this translational medicinebased narrative review, the following pathologic metabolic pathways, deriving from hemoglobin denaturation and iron metabolism dysregulation, are highlighted: i) decrease of functioning hemoglobin quote; ii) iron overload in cell/tissue (hyperferritinemia); iii) release of free toxic circulating heme; iv) hypoxemia and systemic hypoxia; v) reduction of nitric oxide; vi) coagulation activation; vii) ferroptosis with oxidative stress and lipoperoxidation; viii) mitochondrial degeneration and apoptosis. […] We speculated that in COVID-19, beyond the classical pulmonary immune-inflammation view, the occurrence of an oxygen-deprived blood disease, with iron metabolism dysregulation, should be taken in consideration. […] A more comprehensive diagnostic/therapeutic approach to COVID-19 is proposed, including potential adjuvant interventions aimed at improving hemoglobin dysfunction, iron over-deposit and generalized hypoxic state.

Recent advances in understanding the mechanism of action of COVID-19 have shown that it causes a systemic infection that significantly affects the hematopoietic system and hemostasis, factors extremely dependent of light, mainly in the region of visible and infrared radiation. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> In the COVID-19 patients hemoglobin is decreasing and protoporphyrin is increasing, generating an extremely harmful accumulation of iron ions in the bloodstream, which are able to induce an intense inflammatory process in the body with a consequent increase in C-reactive protein and albumin. […] According to the theory of electron excitation in photosensitive molecules, similar to hemoglobin heme, after the photon absorption there would be an increase in the stability of the iron ion bond with the center of the pyrrole ring, preventing the losses of heme function oxygen transport (HbO<sub>2</sub>).

Iron metabolism and immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have not been described yet in intensive care patients, although they are likely involved in Covid-19 pathogenesis. […] We performed an observational study during the peak of pandemic in our intensive care unit, dosing D-dimer, C-reactive protein, troponin T, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation, transferrin soluble receptor, lymphocyte count and NK, CD3, CD4, CD8 and B subgroups of 31 patients during the first 2 weeks of their ICU stay. […] The same trend is observed with serum iron levels (median 25.5 μg/L, IQR 69 μg/L at admission; median 73 μg/L, IQR 56 μg/L on days 3 to 6) without reaching statistical significance. […] The description of iron metabolism and lymphocyte count in Covid-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit provided with this paper might allow a wider understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology.

Various types of pulmonary diseases are associated with iron deficiency. […] However, information on iron status in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is scarce. […] The role of serum iron in predicting severity and mortality of COVID-19 was evaluated. […] Of the 50 patients, 45 (90%) patients had abnormally low serum iron levels (&lt;7.8 μmol/L). […] The severity of COVID-19 was negatively correlated with serum iron levels before and after treatment and was positively correlated with C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, urea nitrogen, and myoglobin levels. […] Decreased serum iron level could predict the transition of COVID-19 from mild to severe and critical illness. […] Seven (53.8%) patients with a lower serum iron level after treatment in the critical group had died. […] There was a significant difference in posttreatment serum iron levels between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors. […] Serum iron deficiency was detected in the patients with COVID-19. […] The severity and mortality of the disease was closely correlated with serum iron levels. […] Low serum iron concentration was an independent risk factor for death in COVID-19 patients.

We have previously defined ferrosenescence as an iron-associated disruption of both the human genome and its repair mechanisms, leading to premature cellular senescence and neurodegeneration. […] As viruses replicate more efficiently in iron-rich senescent cells, they may have developed the ability to induce this phenotype in host tissues, predisposing to both immune dysfunction and neurodegenerative disorders. […] In this mini-review, we summarize what is known about the SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular senescence and iron dysmetabolism. […] We also take a closer look at immunotherapy with natural killer cells, angiotensin II receptor blockers (“sartans”), iron chelators and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (“gliptins”) as adjunct treatments for both COVID-19 and its neurodegenerative complications.

Iron is an essential trace element to almost all organism, and the delicate balance between host defend system and viral proliferation plays an important role in infective conditions. […] While the association of the iron metabolism with the prognosis of COVID-19 remains poorly understood. […] We aimed to estimate the associations of systemic iron metabolism parameters with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19. […] Multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate the association of iron parameter levels with the severity and risks of adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. […] After adjusting for age, sex, IL-6, and pre-existing comorbidities, all iron parameters were associated with the severity of COVID-19 with adjusted risk ratio of 0.42 [95% CI: 0.22-0.83], 4.38 [95% CI: 1.86-10.33], 0.19 [95% CI: 0.08-0.48], and 0.25 [95% CI: 0.10-0.58] for serum iron, ferritin, transferrin, and total iron-binding capacity, respectively. […] These iron indices were also related to the risk of ARDS, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, acute liver injury, and acute kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high cytokine concentrations. […] Patients with low serum iron status likely suffered from severe condition and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. […] The iron metabolism parameters might be risk factors and clinical biomarkers for COVID-19 prognosis.

Accumulating evidence suggests that there are important contributions to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from redox imbalance and improperly coordinated iron, which cause cellular oxidative damage and stress. […] Cells have developed elaborate redox-dependent processes to handle and store iron, and their disfunction leads to several serious diseases. […] These complicated interrelationships are presented in terms of a cellular redox/iron/ROS triad, including ROS generation both at improperly coordinated iron and enzymatically, ROS interconvertibility, cellular signaling and damage, and reductant and iron chelator concentration-dependent effects.

Iron deficiency is the commonest cause for anaemia worldwide making it a formidable issue particularly during pregnancy because of increased iron demands. […] This study looked at establishing a lower limit of normal for haemoglobin concentration (Hb) in our population and to proactively address potentially symptomatic iron deficiency during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. […] In addition there was evidence of limited testing performed to look for iron deficiency with only 18 % having a serum ferritin checked. […] Most anaemia was normocytic suggesting that microcytosis is only a late marker of iron deficiency lacking sensitivity.

Iron overload is increasingly implicated as a contributor to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. […] Indeed, several of the manifestations of COVID-19, such as inflammation, hypercoagulation, hyperferritinemia, and immune dysfunction are also reminiscent of iron overload. […] Although iron is essential for all living cells, free unbound iron, resulting from iron dysregulation and overload, is very reactive and potentially toxic due to its role in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). […] Moreover, iron-catalyzed lipid damage exerts a direct causative effect on the newly discovered nonapoptotic cell death known as ferroptosis. […] Iron chelators are generally safe and are proven to protect patients in clinical conditions characterized by iron overload. […] There is also an abundance of evidence that iron chelators possess antiviral activities. […] Furthermore, the naturally occurring iron chelator lactoferrin (Lf) exerts immunomodulatory as well as anti-inflammatory effects and can bind to several receptors used by coronaviruses thereby blocking their entry into host cells. […] Iron chelators may consequently be of high therapeutic value during the present COVID-19 pandemic.

We hypothesised that preoperative intravenous iron and tranexamic acid (TXA) may reduce the transfusion rate in these patients. […] The HiFIT study is a multicentre, 2×2 factorial, randomised, double-blinded, controlled trial evaluating the effect of iron isomaltoside (IIM) (20 mg/kg) vs placebo and of TXA (intravenously at inclusion and topically during surgery) versus placebo on transfusion rate during hospitalisation, in patients undergoing emergency surgery for HF and having a preoperative haemoglobin between 95 and 130 g/L. 780 patients are expected. […] The HiFIT trial will be the largest study evaluating iron and TXA in patients with HF. clinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02972294; EudraCT Number 2016-003087-40.

Clinical observations in concert with literary data demonstrate that detrimental complications of COVID19-induced pathology (acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, Kawasaki-like disease etc.), could result from a disturbance of local iron homeostasis (FeH) in damaged tissues followed by abnormal coagulation in small vessels. […] Therefore, both local and systemic hepcidin levels could serve as a dynamic marker of disease progression (the more hepcidin the worse is disease) and treatment efficacy (after iron homeostasis is recovered hepcidin disappears).
