This paper briefly summarizes why cimetidine or famotidine, dipyridamole, fenofibrate or bezafibrate, and sildenafil citrate are worth considering for patients with COVID-19. […] Clinical trials to assess efficacy are already underway for famotidine, dipyridamole, and sildenafil, and further trials of all these agents will be important in due course.

The over-the-counter histamine-2 receptor antagonist famotidine is a putative therapy for COVID-19. […] We quantitively assessed longitudinal changes in patient reported outcome measures in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose famotidine orally. […] Data on demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, famotidine use, drug-related side effects, temperature measurements, oxygen saturations and symptom scores were obtained using questionnaires and telephone interviews. […] Ten consecutive patients with COVID-19 who self-administered high-dose oral famotidine were identified. […] The most frequently used famotidine regimen was 80 mg three times daily (n=6) for a median of 11 days (range: 5-21 days). […] Famotidine was well tolerated. […] All patients reported marked improvements of disease related symptoms after starting famotidine. […] The combined symptom score improved significantly within 24 hours of starting famotidine and peripheral oxygen saturation (n=2) and device recorded activity (n=1) increased. […] The results of this case series suggest that high-dose oral famotidine is well tolerated and associated with improved patient-reported outcomes in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19.

Famotidine, a class A G protein-coupled receptor antagonist used for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux was recently identified in an in silico screening. […] Additionally, a recent retrospective clinical report showed that the treatment with famotidine provided a good outcome in patients infected with SARS-CoV2. […] A clinical trial testing effectiveness of famotidine in combination with hydroxychloroquine is currently ongoing in the United States (US). […] In the 1990s, famotidine was described as an antiviral agent against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). […] However, it is not clear if famotidine could be effective against SARS-CoV2. […] Thus, by using a computational analysis, we aimed to examine if the antiviral effect of famotidine could be related to the inhibition of proteases involved in the virus replication. […] Our results showed that famotidine could interact within the catalytic site of the three proteases associated with SARS-CoV2 replication. […] However, weak binding affinity of famotidine to these proteases suggests that a successful famotidine therapy could likely be achieved only in combination with other antiviral drugs. […] Finally, analysis of famotidine’s pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that its effect against SARS-CoV2 infection could be reached only upon intravenous administration. […] This work will contribute to the pharmacological knowledge of famotidine as an antiviral agent against SARS-CoV2.

To compare outcomes in patients hospitalized with coronavirus (COVID-19) receiving famotidine therapy with those not receiving famotidine. […] Of 878 patients in the analysis, 83 (9.5%) received famotidine. […] In comparison to patients not treated with famotidine, patients treated with famotidine were younger (63.5 ± 15.0 vs 67.5 ± 15.8 years, P = 0.021), but did not differ with respect to baseline demographics or preexisting comorbidities. […] Use of famotidine was associated with a decreased risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.16-0.86, P = 0.021) and combined death or intubation (odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.96, P = 0.040). […] In addition, patients receiving famotidine displayed lower levels of serum markers for severe disease including lower median peak C-reactive protein levels (9.4 vs 12.7 mg/dL, P = 0.002), lower median procalcitonin levels (0.16 vs 0.30 ng/mL, P = 0.004), and a nonsignificant trend to lower median mean ferritin levels (797.5 vs 964.0 ng/mL, P = 0.076). […] Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that famotidine was an independent predictor of both lower mortality and combined death/intubation, whereas older age, body mass index &gt;30 kg/m, chronic kidney disease, National Early Warning Score, and higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio were all predictors of both adverse outcomes. […] Famotidine use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is associated with a lower risk of mortality, lower risk of combined outcome of mortality and intubation, and lower levels of serum markers for severe disease in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.(

A physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine was performed in hospitalized patients with severe to critical pulmonary symptoms. […] Pulmonologists led the inpatient care in a single medical center of 110 high-acuity patients that were treated with cetirizine 10 mg b.i.d. and famotidine 20 mg b.i.d. plus standard-of-care. […] This physician-sponsored cohort study of cetirizine and famotidine provides proof-of-concept of a safe and effective method to reduce the progression in symptom severity, presumably by minimizing the histamine-mediated cytokine storm.

receptor antagonist famotidine could help treat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) appeared from April 2020. […] A systematic literature search was performed by 19 September 2020, and updated on 28 October 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar using (COVID-19 OR coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (histamine antagonist OR famotidine OR cimetidine). […] ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for COVID-19 and (famotidine or histamine). receptor antagonists may interact with key viral enzymes. […] However, in vitro studies have to date failed to show a direct inhibition of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2 replication. receptor-mediated immunomodulatory actions on mast cell histamine-cytokine cross-talk, rather than a direct action on SARS-CoV-2.

Published studies of famotidine for COVID-19 have focused on acute illness, and none have reported on neuropsychiatric symptoms. […] Famotidine 20 mg twice daily administered orally was begun without any additional medications. […] Improvement was sustained through 12 weeks of follow-up during which the patient continued to take famotidine without apparent side effects. […] Controlled clinical research on famotidine for COVID-19 should follow, as well as the development of valid and reliable research diagnostic criteria to define and operationalize the features of a putative COVID-19 neuropsychiatric residual.

Recently, global attention has turned to preliminary reports on the promising anti-COVID-19 effect of histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs), most especially Famotidine. […] Molecular docking was performed between four H2RAs, Cimetidine, Famotidine, Nizatidine, Ranitidine, and three non-structural proteins viz. […] Thereafter, Famotidine and Cimetidine were subjected to gene target prediction analysis using HitPickV2 and eXpression2Kinases server to determine the possible network of genes associated with their anti-COVID activities. […] Results obtained from molecular docking showed the superiority of Famotidine and Cimetidine compared to other H2RAs with a higher binding affinity to all selected targets. […] Molecular dynamic simulation and MMPBSA results revealed that Famotidine as well as Cimetidine bind to non-structural proteins more efficiently with high stability over 100 ns. […] Results obtained suggest that Famotidine and Cimetidine could be a viable option to treat COVID-19 with a mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of viral replication through the inhibition of non-structural proteins.

The H-2 blocker famotidine has been suggested as an FDA-approved drug that could potentially be repurposed for treatment of COVID-19. […] Famotidine has since been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce symptom severity in patients acutely ill with COVID-19. […] The purpose of the present study was to determine whether famotidine or any other antireflux medications have a prophylactic or detrimental effect for SARS-CoV-2 infection when taken regularly for the management of acid reflux. […] Famotidine use was not associated with incidence of laboratory-confirmed (P= 0.717) or symptomatically suspected (P= 0.876) COVID-19. […] There was no association between incidence of COVID-19 and use of reflux medications, including famotidine at doses used orally to manage reflux and high dose PPIs.

Famotidine has been posited as a potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] We compared the incidence of COVID-19 outcomes (i.e., death and death or intensive services use) among hospitalized famotidine users vs proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) users, hydroxychloroquine users, or famotidine nonusers separately. […] Famotidine, PPI, and hydroxychloroquine exposure groups were defined as patients dispensed any medication containing 1 of the 3 drugs on the day of admission. […] The famotidine nonuser group was derived from the same source population with no history of exposure to any drug with famotidine as an active ingredient before or on the day of admission. […] We identified 2,193 users of PPI, 5,950 users of the hydroxychloroquine, 1,816 users of famotidine, and 26,820 nonfamotidine users. […] After propensity score stratification, the hazard ratios (HRs) for death were as follows: famotidine vs no famotidine HR 1.03 (0.89-1.18), vs PPIs: HR 1.14 (0.94-1.39), and vs hydroxychloroquine: 1.03 (0.85-1.24). […] We found no evidence of a reduced risk of COVID-19 outcomes among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who used famotidine compared with those who did not or compared with PPI or hydroxychloroquine users.
