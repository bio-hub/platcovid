Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. […] Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. […] Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. […] A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. […] Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. […] Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents.

In silico modelling has identified several natural products including quercetin as potential highly effective disruptors of the initial infection process involving binding to the interface between the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) Viral Spike Protein and the epithelial cell Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein. […] Here we argue that the oral route of administration of quercetin is unlikely to be effective in clinical trials owing to biotransformation during digestion, absorption and metabolism, but suggest that agents could be administered directly by alternative routes such as a nasal or throat spray.

Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties have been investigated in numerous studies. […] There is evidence that vitamin C and quercetin co-administration exerts a synergistic antiviral action due to overlapping antiviral and immunomodulatory properties and the capacity of ascorbate to recycle quercetin, increasing its efficacy. […] We present the current evidence for the use of vitamin C and quercetin both for prophylaxis in high-risk populations and for the treatment of COVID-19 patients as an adjunct to promising pharmacological agents such as Remdesivir or convalescent plasma.

By screening of a small chemical library consisting of about 150 compounds, the natural product quercetin was identified as reasonably potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (Ki ~ 7 μM). […] Quercetin could be shown to interact with 3CLpro using biophysical techniques and bind to the active site in molecular simulations. […] Quercetin, with well-known pharmacokinetic and ADMET properties, can be considered as a good candidate for further optimization and development, or repositioned for COVID-19 therapeutic treatment.

[…] A phospholipid complex of quercetin (Quercetin Phytosome®) has been recently tested in humans to evaluate a possible improvement in oral bioavailability. […] After hydrolysis of the conjugated form (mainly glucuronide) of quercetin found in human plasma, the pharmacokinetics results have demonstrated an increased bioavailability rate by about 20-fold for total quercetin.
