For standard-risk patients, we recommend the following: ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRd) (preferred), cyclophosphamide lenalidomide and dexamethasone (CRd), daratumumab lenalidomide and dexamethasone (DRd), lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVd), or cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD). […] For high-risk patients we recommend carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) (preferred) or RVd. […] Decreasing the dose of dexamethasone to 20 mg and giving bortezomib subcutaneously once a week is recommended.

Dexamethasone, a widely prescribed antiemetic for acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from a variety of cancer drugs, causes B and T cell depletion, which may augment immunosuppression. […] Since it seems that lymphocytes are vital in the immune response to novel coronavirus, oncologists should reconsider the <i>routine</i> use of prophylactic dexamethasone in uninfected patients, to avoid inducing lymphopenia, which may increase risk of infection or lead to inferior outcomes if a cancer patient subsequently becomes infected. […] Since many cancer drugs and malignant diseases inherently cause lymphopenia, further reduction of lymphocytes with dexamethasone should be avoided if possible and if safe and effective alternative antiemetics are available during the COVID-19 crisis.

Recent announcements indicated, without sharing any distinct published set of results, that the corticosteroid dexamethasone may reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients only. […] Dexamethasone is a synthetic corticosteroid approved by the FDA 1958 as a broad-spectrum immunosuppressor and it is about 30 times as active and with longer duration of action (2-3 days) than cortisone. […] Dexamethasone would limit the production of and damaging effect of the cytokines, but will also inhibit the protective function of T cells and block B cells from making antibodies, potentially leading to increased plasma viral load that will persist after a patient survives SARS. […] Moreover, dexamethasone would block macrophages from clearing secondary, nosocomial, infections. […] Hence, dexamethasone may be useful for the short-term in severe, intubated, COVID-19 patients, but could be outright dangerous during recovery since the virus will not only persist, but the body will be prevented from generating protective antibodies. […] Instead, a pulse of intravenous dexamethasone may be followed by administration of nebulized triamcinolone (6 times as active as cortisone) to concentrate in the lungs only.

Therefore, we designed a trial to test our hypothesis that early administration of dexamethasone in combination with IV-IG and interferon-beta can reduce the effect of the cytokine storm in critically ill patients COVID-19. […] The age range of patients will be 18-70 years old. the need for intubation; allergy, intolerance, or contraindication to any study drug including dexamethasone, IV-IG, and interferon-beta; pregnancy or lactation; known HIV positive or active hepatitis B or C. […] Each patient in the Intervention Group 1 will receive the standard treatment for COVID-19 and dexamethasone, at the first 24 hours’ time of admission. […] The intervention begins with the administration of dexamethasone based on the SpO<sub>2</sub> levels. […] If the level of SpO<sub>2</sub> does not improve after 24 hours, IV-IG (400 mg/kg once daily for 5 days) and interferon-beta (7 doses every other day) will be prescribed along with dexamethasone administration. […] In Intervention Group 2, the administration of dexamethasone will be started within the first 24 hours’ time of admission and will be continued for 48-72 hours and then the SpO<sub>2</sub> level will be checked.

Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. […] We reviewed the charts of SARS-CoV-2 patients with pneumonia and moderate to severely elevated CRP and worsening hypoxemia who were treated with early, short-term dexamethasone. […] We describe a series of 21 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to The Miriam Hospital in Providence, RI, and were treated with a short course of dexamethasone, either alone or in addition to current investigative therapies. […] CRP levels decreased significantly following the start of dexamethasone from mean initial levels of 129.52 to 40.73 mg/L at time of discharge. 71% percent of the patients were discharged home with a mean length of stay of 7.8 days.

Although therapies selectively down-regulating both AhR and IDO1 are currently lacking, medications in clinical use such as dexamethasone may down-regulate both AhR and IDO1 genes, as calcitriol/vitamin D3 may down-regulate the AhR gene, and tocopherol/vitamin E may down-regulate the IDO1 gene. […] Supplementation of calcitriol should therefore be subjected to epidemiological studies and tested in prospective trials for prevention of CoV infections, as should tocopherol, whereas dexamethasone could be tried in interventional trials.

Dexamethasone is commonly used for antiemetic prophylaxis with systemic therapy for cancer. […] However, dexamethasone is associated with increased risk of viral and respiratory infections, and causes lymphopenia, which is associated with worse outcomes during COVID-19 infections. […] Our purpose was to minimize dexamethasone exposure during antiemetic prophylaxis for systemic therapy for solid tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic, while maintaining control of nausea and emesis. […] No studies considered the impact of dexamethasone-based antiemetic regimens on the risk and severity of COVID-19 infection. […] Clinicians should prescribe the minimally effective dose of dexamethasone for antiemetic prophylaxis. […] Single-day dexamethasone dosing is recommended over multi-day dosing for regimens with high emetogenic risk excluding high-dose cisplatin, preferably in combination with palonosetron, netupitant, and olanzapine. […] For regimens with low emetogenic risk, 5-HT3 antagonists are recommended over dexamethasone.

RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases.

Recently, four large Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) have been performed in record time delivering reliable data: (1) the National Institutes of Health (NIH) RCT included 60 hospitals participating all over the world and showed the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing the recovery time in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 pneumonia; (2) three large RCTs already completed, for hydroxychloroquine, dexamethasone and Lopinavir and Ritonavir respectively. […] These three ‘Recovery’ RCTs concluded definitely: (a) that treatment with hydroxychloroquine provides no benefits in patients hospitalized with COVID-19; (b) that treatment with dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in COVID-19 patients that were mechanically ventilated, and by one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen only; (c) that the combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir is not effective in reducing mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.

Dexamethasone, a widely used corticosteroid, has recently been reported as the first drug to increase the survival chances of patients with severe COVID-19. […] Therapeutic agents, including dexamethasone, are mostly transported through the body by binding to serum albumin. […] Here, the first structure of serum albumin in complex with dexamethasone is reported. […] Dexamethasone binds to drug site 7, which is also the binding site for commonly used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and testosterone, suggesting potentially problematic binding competition. […] This study bridges structural findings with an analysis of publicly available clinical data from Wuhan and suggests that an adjustment of the dexamethasone regimen should be further investigated as a strategy for patients affected by two major COVID-19 risk factors: low albumin levels and diabetes.

Interferon-α (IFN-α), lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine phosphate, arbidol, ribavirin, remdesivir, and dexamethasone are the therapeutic drugs recommended for treating 2019-nCoV disease (COVID-19 disease). […] According to the current literature we reviewed, we suggest that IFN-α and arbidol can be retained in the treatment regimen for pregnant women and that to reduce maternal mortality, appropriate doses of dexamethasone can be given to those who are predicted to have low premature survival and to receive mechanical ventilation or oxygen. […] However, the use of dexamethasone in the 1st trimester and after 37 weeks of gestation should be avoided.

The first drug that has shown promise in reducing COVID-19 mortality in severely-ill patients is dexamethasone, a cheap, well-known anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid, approved for the treatment of inflammatory conditions including respiratory diseases such as asthma and tuberculosis. […] However, about 80% of COVID-19 patients requiring oxygenation, and about 67% of patients on ventilators, are not responsive to dexamethasone therapy mainly. […] Additionally, using higher doses of dexamethasone for prolonged periods of time can lead to severe side effects and some patients may develop corticosteroid resistance leading to treatment failure. […] In order to increase the therapeutic efficacy of dexamethasone in COVID-19 patients, while minimizing dexamethasone-related complications that could result from using higher doses of the drug, we applied a chemocentric informatics approach to identify combination therapies. […] Our results indicated that combining dexamethasone with fast long-acting beta-2 adrenergic agonists (LABAs), such as formoterol and salmeterol, can ease respiratory symptoms hastily, until dexamethasone’s anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects kick in. […] Our studies demonstrated that LABAs and dexamethasone (or other glucocorticoids) exert synergistic effects that will augment both anti-inflammatory and fibronectin-mediated anticoagulant effects.

Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) biologicals, Dexamethasone and rIL-7 are of considerable interest in treating COVID-19 patients who are in danger of, or have become, seriously ill. […] The positive outcome of a large scale trial of dexamethasone, and its higher potency late in the disease, harmonises well with its capacity to enhance levels of IL-7Rα, the receptor for IL-7, a cytokine that enhances lymphocyte development and is increased during the cytokine storm. […] Thus the IL-7- enhancing activity of dexamethasone may explain its higher potency when lymphocytes are depleted later in the infection, while employing anti-TNF, for several reasons, is much more logical earlier in the infection.
