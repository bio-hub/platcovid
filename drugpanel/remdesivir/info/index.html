Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. […] Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. […] Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. […] Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. […] The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial.

[…] Simulated drug exposures following a 5-day course of hydroxychloroquine (400 mg every 12 hours × 2 doses followed by 200 mg every 12 hours × 8 doses) and a single 200-mg intravenous dose of remdesivir were computed for simulated adult participants. […] For remdesivir, the primary outcome was plasma exposure (area under the curve, 0 to infinity) following single-dose administration.

[…] In contrast to vehicle-treated animals, animals treated with remdesivir did not show signs of respiratory disease and had reduced pulmonary infiltrates on radiographs and reduced virus titers in bronchoalveolar lavages 12hrs after the first treatment administration. […] Virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract was not reduced by remdesivir treatment. […] At necropsy, lung viral loads of remdesivir-treated animals were lower and there was a reduction in damage to the lungs. […] Thus, therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated early during infection had a clinical benefit in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. […] Although the rhesus macaque model does not represent the severe disease observed in a proportion of COVID-19 patients, our data support early remdesivir treatment initiation in COVID-19 patients to prevent progression to pneumonia.

Recently, because of its positive results in clinical trials, remdesivir was approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 through Emergency Use Authorization. […] Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations and free energy perturbation methods to study the inhibition mechanism of remdesivir to its target SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). […] We then built a putative preinsertion binding structure by aligning the remdesivir + RdRp complex to the ATP bound poliovirus RdRp without the RNA template. […] The resulting stable preinsertion state of remdesivir appeared to form hydrogen bonds with the RNA template when aligned with the newly solved cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. […] The relative binding free energy between remdesivir and ATP was calculated to be -2.80 ± 0.84 kcal/mol, where remdesivir bound much stronger to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp than the natural substrate ATP. […] The ∼100-fold improvement in the <i>K</i><sub>d</sub> from remdesivir over ATP indicates an effective replacement of ATP in blocking of the RdRp preinsertion site. […] Key residues D618, S549, and R555 are found to be the contributors to the binding affinity of remdesivir. […] These findings suggest that remdesivir can potentially act as a SARS-CoV-2 RNA-chain terminator, effectively stopping its RNA replication, with key residues also identified for future lead optimization and/or drug resistance studies.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a novel monophosphoramidate adenosine analog prodrug that exhibits potent antiviral activity against diverse RNA virus families, including positive-sense Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae and negative-sense Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Pneumoviridae. […] Currently, remdesivir is under phase 3 clinical development for disease COVID-19 treatment. […] Here, we found that remdesivir impeded both EV71 viral RNA (vRNA) and complementary (cRNA) synthesis, indicating that EV71 replication is inhibited by the triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir. […] Moreover, remdesivir showed potent antiviral activity against diverse enteroviruses. […] These data extend the remdesivir antiviral activity to enteroviruses and indicate that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment for EV71 and other enterovirus infections.

Thus, this study aimed at conducting a review of the use of Remdesivir in patients with COVID-19. […] On May 1, Remdesivir received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. […] Remdesivir is currently the most promising molecule in the treatment of COVID-19, taking into account its broad antiviral spectrum (considering the genetic sequences of the virus, it is expected to maintain activity against SARS-CoV-2). […] Further studies are relevant as available data on the efficacy and safety of Remdesivir against SARS-nCoV-2 are limited.

In this study, referencing the data published on the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 7BV2) on April 22, we conducted a detailed analysis of the interaction between the complex structures of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 and Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, from the quantum chemical perspective based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method. […] In addition to the hydrogen bonding and intra-strand stacking between complementary strands as seen in normal base pairs, Remdesivir bound to the terminus of an primer-RNA strand was further stabilized by diagonal π-π stacking with the -1A’ base of the complementary strand and an additional hydrogen bond with an intra-strand base, due to the effect of chemically modified functional group. […] We quantitatively revealed the exhaustive interaction within the complex among Remdesivir, template-primer-RNA, RdRp and co-factors, and published the results in the FMODB database.

Remdesivir is a nucleotide analog prodrug with antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of human coronavirus in cell cultures and mouse models including severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2. […] Recently, the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended remdesivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.1,2 In the remdesivir clinical development program, some cases have raised concerns regarding potential hepatobiliary disorders associated with remdesivir, including in healthy volunteers and patients with COVID-19.3 In cohort studies of patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19 who were treated with compassionate-use remdesivir, elevated hepatic enzymes were the most frequent adverse drug reaction reported.4,5 In the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing the effect of intravenous remdesivir in adults admitted to hospital with severe COVID-19 (n = 237), a higher proportion of remdesivir recipients than placebo recipients had dosing prematurely stopped by the investigators because of adverse events including aminotransferase or bilirubin increases (3 versus 0).6 Although there is no signal from the available data of severe hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver injury in clinical trials, the number of patients exposed to remdesivir was too limited. […] Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the hepatic safety profile associated with remdesivir in COVID-19 patients.

What is the role of remdesivir in the treatment of severe covid-19? […] Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. […] After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice. […] The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir. […] The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. […] Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. […] Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay. […] Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. […] However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.

The only current FDA-approved treatment, which directly targets the virus, is the ProTide prodrug remdesivir. […] In its activated form, remdesivir prevents viral replication by inhibiting the essential RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. […] Like other ProTide prodrugs, remdesivir contains a chiral phosphorus center. […] The initial selection of the (SP)-diastereomer for remdesivir was reportedly due to the difficulty in producing the pure (RP)-diastereomer of the required precursor. […] However, the two currently known enzymes responsible for the initial activation step of remdesivir are each stereoselective and show differential tissue distribution. […] To help overcome the challenge of obtaining the pure (RP)-diastereomer of remdesivir, we have developed a novel chemoenzymatic strategy that utilizes a stereoselective variant of the phosphotriesterase from Pseudomonas diminuta to enable the facile isolation of the pure (RP)-diastereomer of the chiral precursor for the chemical synthesis of the (RP)-diastereomer of remdesivir.

[…] We found that a single amino acid substitution, F548S, in the Ebola virus polymerase conferred low-level reduced susceptibility to remdesivir. […] The F548 residue is highly conserved in filoviruses but should be subject to specific surveillance among novel filoviruses, in newly emerging variants in ongoing outbreaks, and also in Ebola virus patients undergoing remdesivir therapy.

[…] In this study, remdesivir exhibited up to 60-fold higher antiviral activity in hPSC-CMs compared to Vero E6 cells; however, it also induced moderate cardiotoxicity in these cells. […] To gain further insight into the drug-induced arrhythmogenic risk, we assessed QT interval prolongation and automaticity of remdesivir-treated hPSC-CMs using a multielectrode array (MEA). […] As a result, the data indicated a potential risk of QT prolongation when remdesivir is used at concentrations higher than the estimated peak plasma concentration.

We seek to provide an understanding of the binding mechanism of Remdesivir, provide structural and conformational implications on SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase upon its binding and identify its crucial pharmacophoric moieties. […] To date, the farthest in the drug development pipeline so far is Remdesivir. […] Our analysis showed that the modulatory activity of Remdesivir is characterized by an extensive array of highaffinity and consistent molecular interactions with specific active site residues that anchor Remdemsivir within the binding pocket for efficient binding. […] Results also showed that Remdesivir binding, induces minimal individual amino acid perturbations, subtly interferes with deviations of C-α atoms and restricts the systematic transition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the “buried” hydrophobic region to the “surface-exposed” hydrophilic region. […] We also mapped a pharmacophore model based on observed high-affinity interactions with SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which showcased the crucial functional moieties of Remdesivir and was subsequently employed for virtual screening. […] The structural insights and the optimized pharmacophoric model provided would augment the design of improved analogs of Remdesivir that could expand treatment options for COVID-19.

Remdesivir is currently being evaluated for clinical efficacy and safety in patients with COVID-19. […] To describe the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients following treatment with remdesivir at a community hospital. […] A retrospective review of medical records was conducted in August 2020 for all patients given remdesivir while hospitalized for severe COVID-19 between May 1 and August 19, 2020. […] A convenience sample of consecutive patients with treatment including remdesivir, antibiotics, convalescent plasma, dexamethasone, or a combination of multiple drugs was included in the analysis. […] Patients receiving remdesivir were administered a 5-day treatment course. […] Patients with a glomerular filtration rate of less than 30 mL/min, those with liver function tests 5 times the normal reference range, and those who were pregnant were excluded from treatment with remdesivir. […] Among the 76 patients who received remdesivir, the mean (95% confidence interval, CI) age was 63 years (59.8-66.2). […] The mean (95% CI) length of stay for patients who received remdesivir was 10.09 days (8.6-11.6) and the mean (95% CI) duration of oxygen therapy was 9.42 days (8.0-10.8). […] A total of 14 (18.4%) patients given remdesivir were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with an mean (95% CI) length of stay of 9.29 days (5.6-13.0). […] Women administered remdesivir were more likely to be admitted to the ICU (11 [27.5%] vs 3 [8.3%]; P=.031). […] Remdesivir may show clinical efficacy for the treatment of severe COVID-19 in a community setting. […] Although this was a small-scale study with limited patients, it represents a point of reference for the use of remdesivir at other community hospitals.

Among them, remdesivir, which can block the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in old SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, has been prescribed to COVID-19 patients in many countries. […] A recent experiment showed that remdesivir binds to SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibition constant of μM, but the exact target has not been reported. […] We showed that remdesivir binds to Mpro slightly weaker than to RdRp, and the corresponding inhibition constants, consistent with the experiment, fall to the μM range. […] The binding mechanisms of remdesivir to two targets differ in that the electrostatic interaction is the main force in stabilizing the RdRp-remdesivir complex, while the van der Waals interaction dominates in the Mpro-remdesivir case.

Remdesivir, a broad spectrum anti-viral drug, is now under in vitro and in vivo investigation as a potential agent against SARS-CoV-2. […] Herein, combination molecular docking with dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations is used to theoretically design angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-containing remdesivir-loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy. […] Based on the therapeutic and lung protective effect of ACEI, the classical lisinopril molecule covalently grafted onto PLGA (L-PLGA) has been used to encapsulate remdesivir. […] A binding model is used to confirm the interactions between lisinopril and ACE on the surface of cells, as well as remdesivir and its intracellular targeting protein (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)). […] Furthermore, DPD simulations are applied to study the nano-aggregation of drug-free L-PLGA, and remdesivir loaded in L-PLGA. […] Molecular docking proved that hydrogen bonding was decisive for the encapsulation of remdesivir. […] With an increase in concentration, remdesivir loaded L-PLGA formed spherical NPs, and then underwent precipitation. […] Similar to the above conditions, high remdesivir loading was also observed to cause precipitation formation. […] Thus, the optimized remdesivir NPs in our study give insights into a rational platform for formulation design against this global pandemic.

However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue prodrug originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus, was found to inhibit the replication of a wide range of human and animal coronaviruses in vitro and in preclinical studies. […] It is therefore not surprising that when the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus emerged in late 2019 in China, causing global health concern due to the virus strong human-to-human transmission ability, remdesivir was one of the first clinical candidates that received attention. […] After in vitro studies had shown its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, and a first patient was successfully treated with the drug in the USA, a number of trials on remdesivir were initiated.

[…] The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. […] Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. […] Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. […] We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation.

To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that examined remdesivir treatment for COVID-19. […] A systematic literature search was performed using Pubmed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify studies published up to October 25, 2020 that examined COVID-19 treatment with remdesivir. […] Remdesivir attenuates disease progression, leading to lower odds of MV/ECMO and greater odds of hospital discharge for COVID-19 patients.

The use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. […] Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutation is crucial for the management of remdesivir resistance. […] Using a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping, we generated a total of 100,000 mutations and provided insight into the functional outcomes of mutations in the remdesivir-binding site in nsp12 subunit of RdRp. […] After designing 46 residues in the remdesivir-binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 97%-98% sequence identity, suggesting that very few mutations in nsp12 are required for SARS-CoV-2 to attain remdesivir resistance. […] Several mutants displayed decreased binding affinity to remdesivir, suggesting drug resistance. […] These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutation and thus conferring remdesivir resistance.

Recent efforts to repurpose drugs to combat COVID-19 have identified Remdesivir as a candidate. […] Surprisingly, however, ribavirin and favilavir do not bind the nucleotide on the complementary strand as effectively and seem to act by a different mechanism than remdesivir. […] Remdesivir exhibits similar binding interactions to the natural base adenine. […] Moreover, by analyzing remdesivir at downstream positions of the RNA, we also find that, consistent with a “delayed” termination mechanism, additional nucleotides can be incorporated after remdesivir is added, and its highly polar 1’-cyano group induces a set of conformational changes that can affect the normal RdRp complex function. […] By analyzing the fluctuations of residues that are altered by remdesivir binding, and comparing them to those induced by lethal point mutations, we find a possible secondary mechanism in which remdesivir destabilizes the protein complex and its interactions with the RNA strands.

Remdesivir is being studied and used for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] To update a previous review of remdesivir for adults with COVID-19, including new meta-analyses of patients with COVID-19 of any severity compared with control. […] English-language, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remdesivir for COVID-19. […] Compared with control, a 10-day course of remdesivir probably results in little to no reduction in mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.93 [95% CI, 0.82 to 1.06]; 4 RCTs) but may result in a small reduction in the proportion of patients receiving mechanical ventilation (RR, 0.71 [CI, 0.56 to 0.90]; 3 RCTs). […] Remdesivir probably results in a moderate increase in the percentage of patients who recovered and a moderate decrease in serious adverse events and may result in a large reduction in time to recovery. […] In hospitalized adults with COVID-19, remdesivir probably results in little to no mortality difference but probably improves the percentage recovered and reduces serious harms and may result in a small reduction in the proportion receiving ventilation.

Remdesivir has been recognized as an important medicine in the control of COVID-19 illness. […] Since carbon nanotubes were considered in the design of novel drug delivery vehicles, the interaction between simple CNT, functionalized CNT by carboxylic group and S-, Al-, and Si-doped CNT and Remdesivir drug were studied using density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. […] The results of this work show that the Si-doped CNT is the best drug delivery system for Remdesivir due to its better electronic, energetic, adsorption and thermodynamic properties.

The main progress in international critical care medicine in 2020 are: the reflections on the mandatory of implementation of the 1-hour cluster treatment strategy for sepsis are still continuing; the “metabolic resuscitation” therapy, represented by large dose of vitamin C, failed to yield positive results; the global epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to spread, with evidences indicating Dexamethasone, Remdesivir or interferon β-1b (IFNβ-1b), Lopinavir/Ritonavir and ribavirin as promising therapy; conservative oxygen therapy did not exert positive effects neither for mechanical ventilated patients nor for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patient; the concept of lung- and diaphragm-protective mechanical ventilation illuminates a new opportunity to potentially improve clinical outcomes for critically ill patients; there was no positive evidence for stress ulcer prophylaxis and timing of endoscopy for severe acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding; early initiation of renal-replacement therapy (RRT) for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has not shown positive effect.
