Metformin was proposed to be a candidate for host-directed therapy for COVID-19. […] In this study, we compared the outcome of metformin users and nonusers in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with diabetes. […] Hospitalized diabetic patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Tongji Hospital of Wuhan, China, from January 27, 2020 to March 24, 2020, were grouped into metformin and no-metformin groups according to the diabetic medications used. […] A total of 283 patients (104 in the metformin and 179 in the no-metformin group) were included in this study. […] The fasting blood glucose level of the metformin group was higher than that of the no-metformin group at admission and was under effective control in both groups after admission. […] The length of hospital stay did not differ between the two groups (21.0 days for metformin versus 19.5 days for no metformin, <i>P</i> = 0.74). […] However, in-hospital mortality was significantly lower in the metformin group (3/104 (2.9%) versus 22/179 (12.3%), <i>P</i> = 0.01). […] Antidiabetic treatment with metformin was associated with decreased mortality compared with diabetics not receiving metformin. […] This retrospective analysis suggests that metformin may offer benefits in patients with COVID-19 and that further study is indicated.

Metformin is capable of suppressing one of the molecular triggers of the proinflammatory and prothrombotic processes of urban PM air pollution, namely the mitochondrial ROS/Ca<sup>2+</sup> release-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (CRAC)/IL-6 cascade. […] Given the linkage between mitochondrial functionality, ion channels, and inflamm-aging, the ability of metformin to target mitochondrial electron transport and prevent ROS/CRAC-mediated IL-6 release might illuminate new therapeutic avenues to quell the raging of the cytokine and thrombotic-like storms that are the leading causes of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in older people. […] The incorporation of infection rates, severity and lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infections as new outcomes of metformin usage in elderly populations at risk of developing severe COVID-19, together with the assessment of bronchial/serological titers of inflammatory cytokines and D-dimers, could provide a novel mechanistic basis for the consideration of metformin as a therapeutic strategy against the inflammatory and thrombotic states underlying the gerolavic traits of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A recent experimental study has suggested an increased toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in association with metformin in mice. […] The present study was undertaken to investigate the reality of this putative drug-drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine and metformin using pharmacovigilance data. […] Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin. […] In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9-139.3). […] In comparison with metformin alone, hydroxychloroquine + metformin was associated with an ROR value of 6.0 (2.6-13.8). […] Our study identified a signal for the association hydroxychloroquine + metformin that appears to be more at risk of fatal outcomes (particularly by completed suicides) than one of the two drugs when given alone.

Metformin remains the first-line pharmacological choice for the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM. […] Because metformin exerts various effects beyond its glucose-lowering action, among which are anti-inflammatory effects, it may be speculated that this biguanide might positively influence the prognosis of patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. […] The present concise review summarizes the available data from observational retrospective studies that have shown a reduction in mortality in metformin users compared with non-users, and briefly discusses the potential underlying mechanisms that might perhaps explain this favourable impact.

[…] Our meta-analysis showed that metformin use is associated with reduction in mortality rate from COVID-19 infections [RR 0.54 (95% CI 0.32-0.90), p = 0.02, I2 = 54%, random-effect modelling]. […] Metformin has shown benefits in reducing the mortality rate from COVID-19 infections. […] Patients with diabetes should be advised to continue taking metformin drugs despite COVID-19 infection status.

Metformin is the most commonly prescribed first-line medication for T2D, but its impact on the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19 and T2D remains to be clarified. […] Our current retrospective study in a cohort of 1,213 hospitalized individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D indicated that metformin use was significantly associated with a higher incidence of acidosis, particularly in cases with severe COVID-19, but not with 28-day COVID-19-related mortality. […] Furthermore, metformin use was significantly associated with reduced heart failure and inflammation. […] Our findings provide clinical evidence in support of continuing metformin treatment in individuals with COVID-19 and pre-existing T2D, but acidosis and kidney function should be carefully monitored in individuals with severe COVID-19.

Metformin, a widely used drug to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) mellitus and metabolic syndrome, has immunomodulatory activity that reduces the production of proinflammatory cytokines using macrophages and causes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). […] Metformin also inhibits the cytokine production of pathogenic Th1 and Th17 cells. […] Importantly, treatment with metformin alleviates various lung injuries in preclinical animal models. […] In addition, a recent proteomic study revealed that metformin has the potential to directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Furthermore, retrospective clinical studies have revealed that metformin treatment reduces the mortality of T2D with COVID-19. […] Therefore, metformin has the potential to be repurposed to treat patients with COVID-19 at risk of developing severe illness.

[…] Among the subgroup with a hemoglobin HbA1c available (n=1,193), the adjusted odds of hospitalization (including adjustment for HbA1c) for metformin users was OR 0.75 (0.53-1.06, p=0.105). […] Outpatient metformin use was associated with a lower mortality and a trend towards decreased admission for COVID-19. […] Given metformin’s low cost, established safety, and the mounting evidence of reduced severity of COVID-19 disease, metformin should be prospectively assessed for outpatient treatment of COVID-19.

The relationship between metformin therapy and the risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has not been reported among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). […] We aimed to investigate whether metformin therapy was associated with the incidence of COVID-19 among type 2 DM patients in South Korea. […] Metformin users were defined as those who had been prescribed continuous oral metformin for over a period of ≥ 90 days, and the control group was defined as all other patients. […] Overall, 27,493 patients with type 2 DM (7204, metformin user group; 20,289, control group) were included. […] In the logistic regression analysis, the odds of metformin users developing COVID-19 was 30% lower than that of the control group [odds ratio (OR): 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.80; P &lt; 0.001]. […] However, in the multivariate model, metformin use was not associated with hospital mortality when compared with that of the control group (OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 0.81-1.95; P = 0.301). […] Metformin therapy might have potential benefits for the prevention of COVID-19 among patients with type 2 DM in South Korea.

Here, we review the role of antidiabetic agents, mainly including insulin, metformin, pioglitazone, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in DM patients with coronavirus infection, addressing the clinical therapeutic choices for these subjects.
