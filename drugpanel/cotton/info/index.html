The objective of this study was to investigate whether cotton mask worn by respiratory infection person could suppress respiratory droplet levels compared to medical mask. […] We recruited adult volunteers with confirmed influenza and suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to wear medical masks and self-designed triple-layer cotton masks in a regular bedroom and a car with air conditioning. […] The results showed that there was no significant difference in NC<sub>0.02-1</sub> or cough/sneeze counts between volunteers with medical masks and cotton masks in a bedroom or a car.

Using a recently validated spray-simulation method (mimicking a sneeze), herein we first determined that combed-cotton textiles used as two-layer-barriers covering the mouse cages prevented the contamination of all GF animals when sprayed 10-20 bacterial-droplet units/cm2. […] In additional to exposure trials, the model showed that GF mice were again protected by the combed-cotton textile after the acute exposure to 10 times more droplets (20 “spray-sneezes”, ~200 bacterial-droplet units/cm2). […] Overall, two-layer combed-cotton protected 100% of the GF mice from bacteria-carrying droplets (n = 20 exposure-events), which was significantly superior compared to 100% mouse contamination without textile coverage or when 95% partly covered (n = 18, Fisher-exact, p &lt; 0.0001). […] Of relevance is that two different densities of cotton were equally effective (100%) in preventing contamination regardless of density (120-vs. 200 g/m2; T-test, p = 0.0028), suggesting that similar density materials could prevent droplet contamination. […] As a practical message, we conducted a speech trial (counting numbers, 1-100) with/without the protection of the same cotton textile used as face cover. […] The trial illustrated that contamination of surfaces occurs at a rate of &gt;2-6 bacteria-carrying saliva-droplets per word (2.6 droplets/cm2, 30 cm) when speaking at 60-70 decibels and that cotton face covers fully prevent bacterial surface contamination.

[…] In flat-cloth experiments, linen tea towels, 600-TPI cotton in 2 layers, and 600-TPI cotton with 90-TPI flannel performed well but 80-TPI cotton in 2 layers did not.
