We argue for inhibition of the TRPV4 calcium-permeable ion channel as a strategy to address this issue, based on the rationale that TRPV4 inhibition is protective in various preclinical models of lung edema, and that TRPV4 hyperactivation potently damages the alveolo-capillary barrier, with lethal outcome.

Azithromycin also can cause modest QT interval prolongation, but not through potent hERG channel blockade, rather when used chronically through an increase in peak and late cardiac sodium current to cause potential loading of cardiomyocytes with sodium and calcium to produce calcium overload.

In an osteoporosis clinic, we advocate the following suggestions to prevent and control osteoporosis during the pandemic period: (1) specialized diagnosis and treatment techniques for osteoporosis patients in the outpatient care, including enhancing the prevention for outpatient medical staff, strengthening awareness of COVID-19 prevention, strictly screening outpatients with COVID-19 infection, and insistent administration of anti-osteoporosis drugs during outbreaks; (2) home prevention for osteoporosis patients including keeping windows open, exposing them to sunlight, supplementing them with enough protein, exercising regularly, and administrating calcium supplements; and (3) simplifying the follow-up and evaluation of osteoporosis using online platforms.

The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations between serum calcium and clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] In this retrospective study, serum calcium levels, hormone levels and clinical laboratory parameters on admission were recorded. […] The median serum calcium levels were 2.12 (IQR, 2.04-2.20) mmol/L, median parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were 55.27 (IQR, 42.73-73.15) pg/mL, and median 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (VD) levels were 10.20 (IQR, 8.20-12.65) ng/mL. […] The serum calcium levels were significantly positively correlated with VD levels (<i>P</i> =0.004) but negatively correlated with PTH levels (<i>P</i> =0.048). […] Patients with lower serum calcium levels (especially ≤2.0 mmol/L) had worse clinical parameters, higher incidences of organ injury and septic shock, and higher 28-day mortality. […] In conclusion, serum calcium was associated with the clinical severity and prognosis of patients with COVID-19.

[…] Serum calcium levels were negatively correlated with leukocytes, CRP, PCT, IL-6 and D-dimer, while positively correlated with lymphocytes and ALB. […] Median serum calcium levels were significantly lower in the patients with poor outcome (2.01(1.97-2.05) vs 2.10(2.03-2.20), p&lt;0.001), and it could predict the prognosis with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.73(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.83, p&lt;0.001).

Studies have shown that the calcium ion (Ca2+) plays important roles both in Alzheimer’s dementia and SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion to host cell entry. […] An elevated level of intracellular calcium causes neuronal dysfunction, cell death, and apoptosis. […] Dysregulation of calcium has also been shown to increase the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein, the hallmark of Alzheimer’s dementia. […] Reversely, deposition of Aβ is also responsible for calcium dysregulation. […] Viruses can also hijack the host cell calcium channels and pumps to release more intracellular Ca2+ to utilize for their life cycle. […] Furthermore, some calcium channel blockers (CCBs), such as nimodipine, memantine, etc., have been reported to be effective in the treatment of dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as have shown inhibition in various virus infections.

Objective: We investigated COVID-19 patients with different serum calcium levels. […] We checked the serum calcium level of the patients based on days after symptom onset as well as the severity of COVID-19. […] Both mild/moderate and severe critical cases we observed showed low calcium level in the early stage of viral infection, while the severe/critical cases showed significant lower calcium level than mild/moderate cases in the early stage. […] We also found that low calcium level related to severe/critical multi-organ injuries especially in the mild/moderate population. […] Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 also correlated to calcium change in both mild/moderate and severe/critical cases. […] Our finding indicates that calcium balance is a primal hit of COVID-19 and a biomarker of clinical severity at the beginning of symptom onset. […] Calcium is closely associated with virus-associated multiple organ injuryes and the increase of inflammatory cytokines. […] Our results provide a new, important indicator of COVID-19 patients from mild/moderate to severe/critical: serum calcium.

Calcium is an essential ion for pathogen survival and virulence and is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response. […] Data regarding levels of calcium in SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. […] We performed a retrospective analysis of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and included all patients who had any serum calcium measurement in the first 72h since hospital admission. […] The main objective was to investigate the relation of low serum calcium with adverse outcome, measured by the requirement of high oxygen support - defined as high flow nasal cannula oxygen, non-invasive mechanical ventilation and/or invasive ventilation - intensive care unit admission or death.
