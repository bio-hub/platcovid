On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. […] Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. […] Measures to prevent or reduce transmission should be implemented in populations at risk.

Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission.

We estimated the basic reproduction number <i>R0</i> of 2019-nCoV to be around 2.2 (90% high density interval: 1.4-3.8), indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission.

In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. […] The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019-2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. […] In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019-nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. […] Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.

To investigate the time origin, genetic diversity, and transmission dynamics of the recent 2019-nCoV outbreak in China and beyond, a total of 32 genomes of virus strains sampled from China, Thailand, and the USA with sampling dates between 24 December 2019 and 23 January 2020 were analyzed. […] Phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood-mapping analyses of the genome sequences were performed. […] We identified three phylogenetic clusters using the Bayesian inference framework and three transmission clusters using transmission network analysis, with only one cluster identified by both methods using the above genome sequences of 2019-nCoV strains. […] On the basis of our study, undertaking epidemiological investigations and genomic data surveillance could positively impact public health in terms of guiding prevention efforts to reduce 2019-nCOV transmission in real-time.

Fortunately, there has only been limited human-to-human transmission outside of China. […] Here, we assess the risk of sustained transmission whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. […] Data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected early in the current outbreak are used to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission. […] Under the assumptions that the imported case is representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained human-to-human transmission is 0.41 (credible interval [0.27, 0.55]). […] However, if the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.012 (credible interval [0, 0.099]).

[…] Outside China, countries with a higher risk of 2019-nCoV transmission are Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Canada and the USA, all of which reported at least one case. […] In Africa and South America, the risk of transmission is very low with Ethiopia, South Africa, Egypt, Mauritius and Brazil showing a similar risk of transmission compared to the risk of any of the countries where at least one case is detected. […] The risk of transmission on 31 January 2020 was very high in neighbouring Asian countries, followed by Europe (UK, France, Russia and Germany), Oceania (Australia) and North America (USA and Canada).

Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. […] We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. […] We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R<sub>0</sub>), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. […] We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. […] Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. […] Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R<sub>0</sub> of 1·5, and 0% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R<sub>0</sub> was 2·5 or 3·5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. […] For R<sub>0</sub> values of 2·5 or 3·5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. […] The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. […] This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

[…] On the basis of our previous research, we systematically introduce how to establish the transmission dynamic models in line with current Chinese prevention and control strategies step by step, according to the different epidemic stages and the improvement of the data. […] By summarized our modelling and assessing ideas, the model formulations vary from autonomous to non-autonomous dynamic systems, the risk assessment index changes from the basic regeneration number to the effective regeneration number, and the epidemic development and assessment evolve from the early SEIHR transmission model-based dynamics to the recent dynamics which are mainly associated with the variation of the isolated and suspected population sizes.

We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. […] The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. […] Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. […] In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. […] Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. […] We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. […] We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. […] To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. […] Based on our estimates of R<sub>t</sub>, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. […] Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. […] As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

If the diagnosis and treatment of malaria cases as well as the investigation and response of the epidemic foci are not carried out timely, it may endanger patients’lives and cause the possible of secondary transmission, which threatens the achievements of malaria elimination in China. […] Due to the extensive spread and high transmission ability of the COVID-19, there is a possibility of virus infections among malaria cases during the medical care-seeking behaviors and among healthcare professionals during clinical diagnosis and treatment, sample collection and testing and epidemiological surveys.

Although we still have limited information on the epidemiology of this virus, there have been multiple reports of superspreading events (SSEs), which are associated with both explosive growth early in an outbreak and sustained transmission in later stages. […] Better understanding transmission dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings, strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future infectious disease outbreaks.

[…] Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Covid‑19 origin and transmission to humans. […] Although to date it is considered that Covid‑19 originates from bats (96.2% overall genome sequence identity) (1), the type of intermediate animals that caused the transmission to humans remains unknown (2-4). […] Zhou et al (1) mentioned that ‘Direct contact with intermediate host animals or consumption of wild animals was suspected to be the main route of SARS‑CoV‑2 transmission. […] However, the source(s) and transmission routine(s) of SARS‑CoV‑2 remain elusive’ (1).

There are a few published cases of COVID-19 occurring during pregnancy and due the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. <b>Results:</b> A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. […] Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. <b>Conclusions:</b> Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses.

The coronavirus (CoV) family consists of viruses that infects a variety of animals including humans with various levels of respiratory and fecal-oral transmission levels depending on the behavior of the viruses’ natural hosts and optimal viral fitness. […] A model to classify and predict the levels of respective respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials of the various viruses was built before the outbreak of MERS-CoV using AI and empirically-based molecular tools to predict the disorder level of proteins. […] Using the percentages of intrinsic disorder (PID) of the nucleocapsid (N) and membrane (M) proteins of CoV, the model easily clustered the viruses into three groups with the SARS-CoV (M PID = 8%, N PID = 50%) falling into Category B, in which viruses have intermediate levels of both respiratory and fecal-oral transmission potentials. […] Later, MERS-CoV (M PID = 9%, N PID = 44%) was found to be in Category C, which consists of viruses with lower respiratory transmission potential but with higher fecal-oral transmission capabilities.

[…] Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community.

The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists’ demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. […] The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. […] A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission. […] Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, and infection controls and measures in dental clinics.

Presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), might pose challenges for disease control. […] Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred. […] Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19. […] Seven COVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases. […] In the four clusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient. […] To account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset. […] Evidence of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the critical role social distancing, including avoidance of congregate settings, plays in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.

[…] This sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. […] As a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies. […] Detection of community transmission is critical for informing response activities, including testing criteria, quarantine guidance, investigation protocols, and community mitigation measures (2).

Among surgeons worldwide, a concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques has been raised due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) with the creation of pneumoperitoneum. […] Due to this proposed concern, we sought to collect the available data and evaluate the use of laparoscopy and the risk of COVID-19 transmission. […] A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID-19 virus was performed. […] Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery, but to date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open or laparoscopic. […] There is no societal consensus on limiting or restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery; however, there is expert consensus on the modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. […] Despite very little evidence to support viral transmission through laparoscopic or open approaches, we recommend making modifications to surgical practice such as the use of smoke evacuation and minimizing energy device use among other measures to minimize operative staff exposure to aerosolized particles.

Most early reports of person-to-person SARS-CoV-2 transmission have been among household contacts, where the secondary attack rate has been estimated to exceed 10% (1), in health care facilities (2), and in congregate settings (3). […] However, widespread community transmission, as is currently being observed in the United States, requires more expansive transmission events between nonhousehold contacts. […] Patients with confirmed COVID-19 and their close contacts were interviewed to better understand nonhousehold, community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. […] This report describes the cluster of 16 cases of confirmed or probable COVID-19, including three deaths, likely resulting from transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at two family gatherings (a funeral and a birthday party). […] These data support current CDC social distancing recommendations intended to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

A range of public health measures have been implemented to suppress local transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong. […] We examined the effect of these interventions and behavioural changes of the public on the incidence of COVID-19, as well as on influenza virus infections, which might share some aspects of transmission dynamics with COVID-19. […] Influenza transmission declined substantially after the implementation of social distancing measures and changes in population behaviours in late January, with a 44% (95% CI 34-53%) reduction in transmissibility in the community, from an estimated R<sub>t</sub> of 1·28 (95% CI 1·26-1·30) before the start of the school closures to 0·72 (0·70-0·74) during the closure weeks. […] Our study shows that non-pharmaceutical interventions (including border restrictions, quarantine and isolation, distancing, and changes in population behaviour) were associated with reduced transmission of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, and are also likely to have substantially reduced influenza transmission in early February, 2020.

International guidance suggests direct droplet transmission is likely and airborne transmission occurs only with aerosol-generating procedures. […] The evidence defining aerosol-generating procedures comes largely from low-quality case and cohort studies where the exact mode of transmission is unknown as aerosol production was never quantified. […] We propose that transmission is associated with time in proximity to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-1 patients with respiratory symptoms, rather than the procedures per se. […] The mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 transmission is unknown but the evidence suggestive of airborne spread is growing. […] Healthcare workers should appraise the current evidence regarding transmission and apply this to the local infection prevalence. […] Measures to mitigate airborne transmission should be employed at times of risk. […] However, the mechanisms and risk factors for transmission are largely unconfirmed.

In this work, we examine an essential factor that characterizes the disease transmission patterns: the interactions among people. […] By integrating the four contact matrices with the next-generation matrix, we quantitatively characterize the underlying transmission patterns of COVID-19 among different populations. […] The results show that the social contact-based analysis can readily explain the underlying disease transmission patterns as well as the associated risks (including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases). […] This can explain why the transmission of COVID-19 in the early stage mainly took place in public places and families in Wuhan. […] We estimate that Feb. 11, 2020 was the date with the highest transmission risk in Wuhan, which is consistent with the actual peak period of the reported case number (Feb. […] We further estimate the disease transmission risks associated with different work resumption plans in these cities after the outbreak. […] With an in-depth characterization of age-specific social contact-based transmission, the retrospective and prospective situations of the disease outbreak, including the past and future transmission risks, the effectiveness of different interventions, and the disease transmission risks of restoring normal social activities, are computationally analyzed and reasonably explained. […] The conclusions drawn from the study not only provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying COVID-19 transmission patterns in China, but more importantly, offer the social contact-based risk analysis methods that can readily be applied to guide intervention planning and operational responses in other countries, so that the impact of COVID-19 pandemic can be strategically mitigated.

The potential to cause life-threatening respiratory failure and rapid transmission puts COVID-19 in the list of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). […] While the SARS-CoV-2 originated in China with over 82,724 confirmed cases and more than 3000 deaths as at the time of writing this review, the rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in exponential increase in the number of cases outside of China to about 10 times the report case and death in mainland China. […] Extreme precautionary measures, such as curfew, shutting of borders and quarantining of individuals suspected to be infected have been instituted with immediate effect; however, due to individuals that are asymptomatic, uncontrolled human-to-human transmission has resulted in exponential infection rate and numerous loss of lives even with this lockdown measures. […] This review article summarizes the developing situation surrounding the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with respect to its epidemiology, unique genomic structure, possible origins, transmission, pathogenesis, comparison with other deadly species of Coronaviruses (CoV) and emerging treatment strategies built on informed literature.

Because of global concern for potential intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from pregnant women to their infants, this report analyzes the effects on pregnancy of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory RNA viruses, and examines the frequency of maternal-fetal transmission with SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza (HPIV) and metapneumovirus (hMPV). […] There have been no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission reported with COVID-19 or any other coronavirus infections. […] In summary, it appears that the absence thus far of maternal-fetal transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the COVID-19 pandemic is similar to other coronaviruses, and is also consistent with the extreme rarity of suggested or confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of other respiratory RNA viruses. […] This observation has important consequences for pregnant women as it appears that if intrauterine transmission of SARSCoV-2 does eventually occur, it will be a rare event.

However, recently published studies support the hypothesis of virus transmission over a distance of 2 m from an infected person. […] Researchers have proved the higher aerosol and surface stability of SARS-COV-2 as compared with SARS-COV-1 (with the virus remaining viable and infectious in aerosol for hours) and that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV can occur besides close-distance contacts. […] Indeed, there is reasonable evidence about the possibility of SARS-COV-2 airborne transmission due to its persistence into aerosol droplets in a viable and infectious form. […] Based on the available knowledge and epidemiological observations, it is plausible that small particles containing the virus may diffuse in indoor environments covering distances up to 10 m from the emission sources, thus representing a kind of aerosol transmission.

Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. […] Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. […] Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons <i>and</i> preventing asymptomatic transmission. […] Even very weak masks (20% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24-65% (and peak deaths 15-69%), compared to 2-9% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9-18%). […] Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic.

Person-to-person transmission is accepted but WHO only considers aerosol transmission when procedures or support treatments that produce aerosol are performed. […] Transmission mechanisms are not fully understood and there is evidence for an airborne route to be considered, as the virus remains viable in aerosols for at least 3 h and that mask usage was the best intervention to prevent infection. […] However, if not correctly used, they may contribute to the transmission/spreading of airborne diseases as proposed in the past for SARS. […] The authors believe that airborne transmission is possible and that HVAC systems when not adequately used may contribute to the transmission of the virus, as suggested by descriptions from Japan, Germany, and the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. […] Previous SARS outbreaks reported at Amoy Gardens, Emergency Rooms and Hotels, also suggested an airborne transmission. […] Further studies are warranted to confirm our hypotheses but the assumption of such way of transmission would cause a major shift in measures recommended to prevent infection such as the disseminated use of masks and structural changes to hospital and other facilities with HVAC systems.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, is spread by human-to-human transmission via droplets or direct contact. […] However, since SARS-CoV-2 (as well as other coronaviruses) has been found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients, the possibility of fecal-oral (including waterborne) transmission need to be investigated and clarified. […] The data available suggest that: i) CoV seems to have a low stability in the environment and is very sensitive to oxidants, like chlorine; ii) CoV appears to be inactivated significantly faster in water than non-enveloped human enteric viruses with known waterborne transmission; iii) temperature is an important factor influencing viral survival (the titer of infectious virus declines more rapidly at 23°C-25 °C than at 4 °C); iv) there is no current evidence that human coronaviruses are present in surface or ground waters or are transmitted through contaminated drinking-water; v) further research is needed to adapt to enveloped viruses the methods commonly used for sampling and concentration of enteric, non enveloped viruses from water environments.

[…] Finally, for the scenario of “panic shopping” or situations where there is a sudden increase in the factors leading to higher exposure to infection, the model predicted an exponential transmission, resulting in failure of the considered intervention strategy. […] Implementation of a strict lockdown for a period of at least 21 days is expected to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. […] However, a further extension of up to 42 days is required to significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19 in India. […] Any relaxation in the lockdown may lead to exponential transmission, resulting in a heavy burden on the health care system in the country.

BackgroundEstimating key infectious disease parameters from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is essential for modelling studies and guiding intervention strategies.AimWe estimate the generation interval, serial interval, proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission and effective reproduction number of COVID-19. […] We illustrate that reproduction numbers calculated based on serial interval estimates can be biased.MethodsWe used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. […] From those estimates, we obtained the serial interval, proportions of pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers.ResultsThe mean generation interval was 5.20 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 3.78-6.78) for Singapore and 3.95 days (95% CrI: 3.01-4.91) for Tianjin. […] The proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission was 48% (95% CrI: 32-67) for Singapore and 62% (95% CrI: 50-76) for Tianjin. […] Sensitivity analyses showed that estimating these quantities from outbreak data requires detailed contact tracing information.ConclusionHigh estimates of the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission imply that case finding and contact tracing need to be supplemented by physical distancing measures in order to control the COVID-19 outbreak.

The virus can be transmitted from person to person, directly or indirectly, via the respiratory, oro-fecal and probably sexual routes.<sup>1</sup> The eventual vertical transmission route is still poorly explored. […] However, mother-to-child SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the placenta probably does not occur, or likely occurs very rarely.<sup>2</sup> All the studies conducted on COVID-19 pregnant women involved patients undergoing cesarean section, but the indications for such delivery modality were not clearly stated.

We analyzed the climate temperature from various regions according to their current ongoing human-to-human transmission status. […] We studied 3 groups; Group 1, 10 provinces from China with majority of COVID-19 cases; Group 2, areas where continuous horizontal transmission outside of China had been reported; and group 3, areas where imported cases had been detected and no horizontal transmission had been documented after at least seven days since the first case was reported. […] The regions without ongoing human-to-human transmission showed significantly higher temperatures when compared to China and countries with ongoing human-to-human transmission, with over an 11-degree difference. […] The average rainfall during the study period was significantly higher in those regions without OHHT when compared to the Chinese provinces with ongoing human-to-human transmission and the regions with active transmission of SARS-CoV-2. […] Our findings show statistically significant differences between regions with ongoing human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 cases compared to those regions without horizontal transmission.

One recent review reported that in a small number of cases, two PCR swabs of the placenta were sent in additional to neonatal and cord blood testing, and both placental PCR swabs were negative.<sup>1</sup> Other studies have demonstrated the finding of SARS-CoV2 IgM in neonates born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy,<sup>2,3</sup> findings that may indicate vertical transmission of the virus in utero. […] While there were no clinical signs of vertical transmission, our findings raise the possibility of intrapartum viral exposure. […] For those infants who were delivered vaginally, contamination with vaginal secretions is also a possible source, although prior studies on vaginal secretions have failed to demonstrate the presence of COVID-19.<sup>5,6</sup>Although all of our neonates tested negative in the first 5 days of life, many were born via cesarean deliveries with decreased length of exposure to these tissues, which may be associated with a decreased likelihood of vertical transmission. […] Additionally, nasopharyngeal testing immediately after delivery may not be the ideal approach to evaluate vertical transmission if exposure occurs at the time of delivery, as the virus may require a longer incubation period before these swabs convert to positive. […] In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.

[…] Two of the cases were linked epidemiologically and thus constituted a COVID-19 cluster with intrahospital HCW-HCW transmission; we also detected 1 family cluster and 2 clusters among HCWs who shared accommodation. […] No transmission to HCWs or patients was detected after containment measures were instituted.

These many paradigmatic aspects include SARS-CoV-2 structure and peculiar biology of infection, high risk of inter-human transmission, long incubation time combined with early and sustained viral load, existence of asymptomatic or mildly-symptomatic carriers, viral shedding for days after symptom relief, unfavorable progression towards respiratory distress and death in up to 5-10% of patients thus causing dramatic healthcare challenges, as well as environmental contamination. […] Last but not least, the combination of the current case fatality rate with the extraordinary number of people that could be potentially infected by SARS-CoV-2 would permit to estimate that the worldwide deaths for COVID-19 may even approximate those recorded during World War II if appropriate restrictive measures for preventing human-to-human transmission are not readily undertaken.

[…] We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. […] While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.

[…] The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization (1). […] These data demonstrate the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the possibility of superemitters contributing to broad transmission in certain unique activities and circumstances. […] It is recommended that persons avoid face-to-face contact with others, not gather in groups, avoid crowded places, maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet to reduce transmission, and wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain.

Finally, our phylogeographic investigations highlighted notable South-North transmission as well as frequent long-distance dispersal events in China that could implicate human-mediated transmission. […] Coronaviruses (CoVs) exhibit a pronounced propensity for interspecies transmission as illustrated by important emerging viruses in humans such as severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS)-CoV, as well as the recent SARS-CoV-2 that is causing a major human pandemic. […] A better understanding of the evolutionary process leading to viral emergence may help unravel the principles of cross-species transmission and therefore assist in preventing future introductions into new host populations. […] Our study provides a deeper understanding of the geographic dispersal of genetic lineages of PDCoV in China and suggests that southern China acted as a source of transmission.

[…] We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission. […] Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route. […] However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other.

[…] Published reports to date suggest that perinatal transmission of SARSCoV- 2 can occur but is rare. […] Among 179 newborns tested for SARS-CoV2 at birth from mothers with COVID-19, transmission was suspected in 8 cases, 5 with positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and 3 with SARS-CoV-2 IgM. […] Welldesigned prospective cohort studies with rigorous judgement criteria are needed to determine the incidence and risk factors for perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

[…] Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (β) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. […] Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates.

The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission poses challenges for control of the COVID-19 pandemic. […] Study of asymptomatic transmission and implications for surveillance and disease burden are ongoing, but there has been little study of the implications of asymptomatic transmission on dynamics of disease. […] We use a mathematical framework to evaluate expected effects of asymptomatic transmission on the basic reproduction number R<sub>0</sub> (i.e., the expected number of secondary cases generated by an average primary case in a fully susceptible population) and the fraction of new secondary cases attributable to asymptomatic individuals. […] If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. […] Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. […] Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics. […] This provides an additional motivation for investigating both the importance and relative duration of asymptomatic transmission.

[…] Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number <i>R</i> and the dispersion parameter <i>k</i> (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13-0.88), respectively.

[…] Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naïve hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P=0.018). […] Surgical mask partition for challenged index hamsters significantly reduced transmission to only 16.7% (2/12, P=0.019) of exposed naïve hamsters.

[…] However, there is limited published literature related to vertical transmission of any human coronaviruses (including SARS-CoV-2) via human milk and/or breastfeeding. […] Results of the literature search reported here (finalized on 17 April 2020) revealed a single study providing some evidence of vertical transmission of human coronavirus 229E; a single study evaluating presence of SARS-CoV in human milk (it was negative); and no published data on MERS-CoV and human milk.

[…] We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. […] We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission.

[…] The degree of risk of transmission from asymptomatic patients to healthcare providers will depend on the prevalence of disease in the population, which is difficult to assess without widespread population screening. […] Aerosol-generating procedures increase the odds of viral transmission from infected symptomatic patients to healthcare providers, but transmission from asymptomatic patients has not been reported. […] Viral transmission from patients exhibiting no symptoms in the operating room is plausible and efforts to reduce risk to healthcare providers include reducing aerosolization and wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, the feasibility of which will vary based on geographic risk and equipment availability.

[…] Singapore provides a unique case example for monitoring transmission, as there have been multiple disease clusters, yet transmission remains relatively continued. […] The local incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics, with the reproduction number following a declining trend and reaching an estimate at 0.7 (95% CI 0.3, 1.0) during the first transmission wave by February 14, 2020, while the overall R based on the cluster size distribution as of March 17, 2020, was estimated at 0.6 (95% CI 0.4, 1.02).

Similarly, the influence of the marketplace on the early transmission dynamics is yet to be investigated. […] Using the daily series of COVID-19 incidence, stratified according to contact history with the market, we have conducted quantitative modeling analyses to estimate the reproduction numbers (R) for market-to-human and human-to-human transmission, the reporting probability, and the early effects of public health interventions. […] We estimated R at 0.24 (95% CrI: 0.01-1.38) for market-to-human transmission and 2.37 (95% CrI: 2.08-2.71) for human-to-human transmission during the early spread in China (2019-2020). […] Moreover, we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2-34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. […] Our R estimate tied to market-to-human transmission had substantial uncertainty, but it was significantly lower compared with the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission.

In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April 2020 with b’<sub>1</sub> = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001) also because of the indirect effect of lockdown, whereas regression coefficient of transmission based on interpersonal contacts has a stable level (b’<sub>2</sub> = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01). […] This result reveals that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of “air pollution-to-human transmission” (airborne viral infectivity) rather than “human-to-human transmission”. […] Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are different for each region and/or city (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc.). […] Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study here suggest that a proactive strategy to cope with future epidemics is also to apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities- (having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and number of fog days) -that seem to have an environment that foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. […] Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, medicine, healthcare and health sector.

We constructed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, estimated the rate of transmission, and calculated the reproductive number in Hubei Province by using case-report data from January 11 to February 6, 2020. […] The possible number of secondary cases outside China was estimated by stochastic simulations in various scenarios of reductions in the duration to quarantine and rate of transmission. […] The rate of transmission was estimated as 0.8238 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8095-0.8382), and the basic reproductive number as 4.1192 (95% CI 4.0473-4.1912). […] Assuming the same rate of transmission as in Hubei Province, the possibility of no local transmission is 54.9% with a 24-h quarantine strategy, and the possibility of more than 20 local transmission cases is 7% outside of China. […] The reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is significantly higher compared to that of the previous SARS epidemic in China. […] This implies that human-to-human transmission is a significant factor for contagion in Hubei Province.

These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. <b>Methods</b>: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. <b>Results</b>: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. […] At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. <b>Conclusions:</b> Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. […] The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies.

Although many pregnant women have been infected by coronavirus, the presence of intrauterine vertical transmission has not been conclusively reported yet. […] Is it only the presence of a strong placental barrier, or is it the natural absence of the some receptor that the viruses use for transmission? […] In this short review, we will try to explain our hypothesis that the lack of caveolin expression in the SCB is one of the most important physiological mechanisms that prevents vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. […] We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact.

Associated surveillance of <i>S. aureus</i> transmission quantifies the effectiveness of the basic measures to prevent the transmission to patients and clinicians of pathogenic bacteria and viruses, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] To measure transmission, the observational units are pairs of successive surgical cases in the same operating room on the same day. […] We evaluated appropriate sample sizes and strategies for measuring transmission. […] Similarly, observing transmission within or between cases of a pair did not increase the probability that the next sampled pair of cases also had observed transmission (all <i>P</i> ≥.23). […] Also, although transmission (yes/no) was associated with surgical site infection (<i>P</i> =.004), among cases with transmission, there was no detected dose response between counts of transmitted isolates and probability of infection (<i>P</i> =.25). […] The first of a fixed series of tests is to use the binomial test to compare the proportion of pairs of cases with <i>S. aureus</i> transmission to an acceptable threshold. […] If significant, more samples are obtained while additional measures are implemented to reduce transmission and infections. […] Because <i>S. aureus</i> transmission is invisible without testing, when choosing what population(s) to screen for surveillance, another endpoint needs to be used (e.g., infections). […] The 10 combinations encompassed ≅17% of cases, showing the value of targeting surveillance of transmission to a few combinations of specialties and rooms. […] In conclusion, we created a sampling protocol and appropriate sample sizes for using <i>S. aureus</i> transmission within and between pairs of successive cases in the same operating room, the purpose being to monitor the quality of prevention of intraoperative spread of pathogenic bacteria and viruses.

During the rapid rise in COVID-19 illnesses and deaths globally, and notwithstanding recommended precautions, questions are voiced about routes of transmission for this pandemic disease. […] Inhaling small airborne droplets is probable as a third route of infection, in addition to more widely recognized transmission via larger respiratory droplets and direct contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces. […] While uncertainties remain regarding the relative contributions of the different transmission pathways, we argue that existing evidence is sufficiently strong to warrant engineering controls targeting airborne transmission as part of an overall strategy to limit infection risk indoors. […] We believe that the use of engineering controls in public buildings, including hospitals, shops, offices, schools, kindergartens, libraries, restaurants, cruise ships, elevators, conference rooms or public transport, in parallel with effective application of other controls (including isolation and quarantine, social distancing and hand hygiene), would be an additional important measure globally to reduce the likelihood of transmission and thereby protect healthcare workers, patients and the general public.

Following identification of novel pathogens, questions in relation to dissemination of the pathogen and transmission routes begin to emerge. […] This rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus has been detected in both faecal and wastewater samples across the globe, highlighting the potential for faecal-oral transmission of the virus. […] As a result, concerns regarding the transmission of the virus in the environment and the risk associated with contracting the virus in recreational waters, particularly where inadequately treated wastewater is discharged, have been emerging in recent weeks.

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures-including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing-might be required to reduce transmission. […] We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence. […] For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40 162 UK participants. […] We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. […] If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. […] If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

This paper investigates the correlation between the high level of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection accelerated transmission and lethality, and surface air pollution in Milan metropolitan area, Lombardy region in Italy. […] At this moment it is not clear if through airborne diffusion, in the presence of outdoor and indoor aerosols, this protein “spike” of the new COVID-19 is involved in the infectious agent transmission from a reservoir to a susceptible host during the highest nosocomial outbreak in some agglomerated industrialized urban areas like Milan is.

Rampant spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cities clearly signals that urban areas contain conditions favorable for rapid transmission of the virus. […] Viewing COVID-19 with a Critical Medical Ecological lens suggests three important interpretations: 1) COVID-19 is equally - if not more - a socially-driven disease as much as a biomedical disease, 2) the present interventions available for primary prevention of transmission are social and behavioral interventions, and 3) wide variation in COVID-19 hospitalization/death rates is not expected to significantly be attributable to a more virulent and rapidly-evolving virus, but rather to differences in social and behavioral factors - and power dynamics - rather than (solely) biological and clinical factors.

Under such circumstances, the use of mathematical models to evaluate the transmission risk of COVID-19 in various facilities represents an important tool in assisting authorities to make informed decisions. […] In this paper, an agent-based model to evaluate the COVID-19 transmission risks in facilities is presented. […] The proposed scheme has been designed to simulate the spatiotemporal transmission process. […] Such rules correspond to spatial patterns and infection conditions under which agents interact to characterize the transmission process. […] Experimental results have demonstrated that the simulations provide useful information to produce strategies for reducing the transmission risks of COVID-19 within the facilities.

[…] The case studies that have come out in different countries have, with prima facie evidence, manifested that the airborne transmission plays a profound role in contracting susceptible hosts. […] The infection propensities in confined spaces (airplane, passenger car, and healthcare center) by the transmission of droplets and aerosols under varying ventilation conditions were discussed.

[…] A negative and exponential relationship was identified between the transmission rate and the temperature (correlation coefficient, -0.56; 99% confidence level).

Recent scientific evidences suggest a relevant role of the oral cavity in the transmission and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. […] Similarly, a decrease in the oral viral load would diminish the amount of virus expelled and reduce the risk of transmission, since (i) during the first 10 days, the virus mainly accumulates at the nasal, oral, and pharyngeal area; (ii) the number of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor is greater in the salivary glands as compared with the lungs; and (iii) salivary droplets represent the most relevant transmission route. […] Antiseptic mouth rinses, such as those containing cetylpyridinium chloride or povidone-iodine, may be able to decrease the severity of COVID-19 by reducing oral viral load in infected subjects and decreasing the risk of transmission by limiting viral load in droplets, generated in normal life, or in aerosols, produced during dental procedures. […] Antiseptic mouth rinses may help in decreasing the severity of COVID-19 and in reducing the risk of transmission.

The objective of the study was to conduct a follow-up investigation of 10 asymptomatic patients at diagnosis among the 98 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported in Busan between February 21 and March 13, 2020 to determine whether asymptomatic infection and transmission during asymptomatic period are possible. […] With regard to whether transmission during the asymptomatic period is possible, it was found that one out of 23 household contacts of the confirmed patients was identified as an additional confirmed case after coming in close contact with an index patient during the presymptomatic period. […] In addition, there was one additional confirmed case in which the patient was a family member who came in close contact with an index patient during the incubation period, thereby confirming that transmission during the asymptomatic period is possible. […] The possibility of transmission during the asymptomatic period has been confirmed; therefore, it is necessary to review the measures for expanding contact tracing that is currently being applied starting one day prior to the onset of symptoms.

Our analyses speculate that the efficient replication and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 might be due to the high-density basic amino acid residues, preferably positioned in close proximity at both the furin-like cleavage sites (S1/S2 and S2’) within the spike protein. […] In this review, we discuss the noteworthy advancements, focusing on the etiological viral agent, comparative genomic analysis, population susceptibility, disease epidemiology and diagnosis, animal reservoirs, laboratory animal models, disease transmission, therapeutics, vaccine challenges, and disease mitigation measures.

Several countries adopted lockdown to slowdown the exponential transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. […] Disease transmission models and the epidemic forecasts at the national level steer the policy to implement appropriate intervention strategies and budgeting. […] The aim of this study is to analyze the transition of the epidemic from subexponential to exponential transmission in the Chennai metro zone and to analyze the probability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) secondary infections while availing the public transport systems in the city. […] The model predicted that transition from subexponential to exponential transmission occurs around the eighth week after the reporting of a cluster of cases. […] Nowcasting at the early stage of the epidemic predicts the probable time point of the exponential transmission and alerts the public health system. […] After the lockdown release, public transportation will be the major source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in metro cities, and appropriate strategies based on nowcasting are needed.

However, another evolving focus is assessing and mitigating the risk of vertical transmission amongst COVID-19-positive mothers. […] The objective of this review was to summarize the current evidence on the vertical transmission potential of COVID-19 infection in the third trimester and its effects on the neonate.Methods: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL) were searched from January 2020 to May 2020, with continuous surveillance.Results: 18 studies met the inclusion criteria, consisting of 157 mothers and 160 neonates. […] Currently, there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs. […] However, this neonate initially tested negative at birth, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was likely hospital-acquired rather than vertically transmitted. 13 (8%) neonates had complications or symptoms.Conclusions: The findings of this rapid descriptive review based on early clinical evidence suggest that vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to neonate/newborn did not occur.

The transmission rates of airborne pathogens from patient to dental health care workers are unknown. […] Therefore, the transmission probability of these airborne infectious diseases was estimated via mathematical modeling. […] The transmission probability was modeled for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, measles virus, influenza virus, and coronaviruses per a modified version of the Wells-Riley equation. […] A high transmission probability was characterized by high patient infectiousness, the absence of respiratory protection, and poor indoor air quality. […] The highest transmission probabilities were estimated for measles virus (100%), coronaviruses (99.4%), influenza virus (89.4%), and M. tuberculosis (84.0%). […] The low-risk scenario leads to transmission probabilities of 4.5% for measles virus and 0% for the other pathogens. […] From the sensitivity analysis, it shows that the transmission probability is strongly driven by indoor air quality, followed by patient infectiousness, and the least by respiratory protection from medical face mask use. […] Airborne infection transmission of pathogens such as measles virus and coronaviruses is likely to occur in the dental practice. […] Improved indoor air quality by ventilation, which reduces carbon dioxide, is the most important factor that will either strongly increase or decrease the probability of the transmission of a pathogen.

Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. […] Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. […] This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. […] Our predicted R0 is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. […] If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed.

The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge. […] Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35-63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9-12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting.

This potentially isolates / quarantines many staff without SARS-CoV-2, whilst not preventing transmission from staff with asymptomatic infection. […] We explored the impact of testing staff on absence durations from work and transmission risks to others. […] Testing all staff (S3) changes the risk of workplace transmission by -56.9 to +1.0 workers per 1,000 tests (with reductions throughout at RT-PCR sensitivity of ≥65%), and absences by 0.5 to +3.6 days per test but at heightened testing needs of 989.6-1995.9 tests per 1,000 workers. […] Testing workers in household-quarantine (S2) reduces absences the most by 3.0-6.9 days per test (at 47.0-210.4 tests per 1,000 workers), while increasing risk of workplace transmission by 0.02-49.5 infected workers per 1,000 tests (which can be minimised when re-testing initially-negative tests). […] Based on optimising absence durations or transmission risk our modelling suggests testing staff in household-quarantine or all staff, depending on infection levels and testing capacities.

The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the awareness of aerosol generation by human expiratory events and their potential role in viral respiratory disease transmission. […] However, the risks of aerosol generation and associated viral transmission by droplet or airborne routes for many otorhinolaryngology procedures are largely unknown. […] Indoor aerosol and droplet viral respiratory transmission risk is influenced by 4 factors: (1) aerosol or droplet properties; (2) indoor airflow; (3) virus-specific factors; and (4) host-specific factors. […] Herein we elaborate on known aerosol vs droplet properties, indoor airflow, and aerosol-generating events to provide context for risks of aerosol infectious transmission. […] Understanding principles of infectious transmission, aerosol and droplet generation, as well as concepts of indoor airflow, will assist in the integration of new data on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and activities that can generate aerosol to best inform on the need for escalation or de-escalation from current societal and institutional guidelines for protection during aerosol-generating procedures.

The aggressive nature of the new SARS-2 corona virus now referred to as SARS-CoV-2 ; the seriousness and length of the period of infection; the fast and far-reaching transmissibility via liquid droplets that become air-borne when someone coughs, sneezes or speaks with increasing evidence to support actual airborne transmission; the presence of viral particles especially in body fluids and tissues, of viral positive individuals; and the persistence of the virus on different types of surfaces pose serious concerns for forensic practitioners, including forensic DNA analysts.

These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a primary receptor for host cell entry. […] Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. […] These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models, and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.

However, the United States and many hard-hit European countries, like Ireland, Italy, Spain, France and the United Kingdom, currently appear content to merely flatten the curve of their epidemic trajectories so that transmission persists at rates their critical care services can cope with. […] Here I present a simple set of arithmetic modelling analyses that are accessible to non-specialists and explain why preferable crush the curve strategies, to eliminate transmission within months, would require only a modest amount of additional containment effort relative to the tipping point targeted by flatten the curve strategies, which allow epidemics to persist at supposedly steady, manageable levels for years, decades or even indefinitely.

[…] The current study uses panel data estimation for the original EU-15 countries in an attempt to explain the role of outside air temperatures, health behavior and government-imposed containment measures on Covid-19 transmission rates. […] Years of education also appears to have a small but negative association with disease transmission rates suggesting that populations with higher educational attainments may be doing a better job of self-protection.

Response to this ongoing pandemic requires extensive collaboration across the scientific community in an attempt to contain its impact and limit further transmission. […] Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R0 (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following the implementation of various interventions (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the expected disease severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the likely true infection rate is often orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone.

There is no proven information about other transmission routes such as fecal-oral transmission. […] Asymptomatic pediatric patients or pediatric patients who have a mild course constitute an important group in terms of transmission of the infection to the advanced age group who carry high risk. […] In order to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, hygienic rules should be pursued in the community, social distancing should be observed, and the family members and contacts of patients who have been diagnosed should be screened and isolated.

Background: Pre-symptomatic transmission can be a key determinant of the effectiveness of containment and mitigation strategies for infectious diseases, particularly if interventions rely on syndromic case finding. […] For COVID-19, infections in the absence of apparent symptoms have been reported frequently alongside circumstantial evidence for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission. […] We estimated the potential contribution of pre-symptomatic cases to COVID-19 transmission. […] Methods: Using the probability for symptom onset on a given day inferred from the incubation period, we attributed the serial interval reported from Shenzen, China, into likely pre-symptomatic and symptomatic transmission. […] Conclusions: Pre-symptomatic transmission may be essential to consider for containment and mitigation strategies for COVID-19.

Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, definitive proof of vertical transmission is still lacking. […] In this review, we summarize studies regarding the potential evidence for transplacental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterize the expression of its receptors and proteases, describe the placental pathology and analyze virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface. […] Based on these data, we conclude that vertical transmission may occur but rare, ascribed to the potent physical barrier, the fine-regulated placental immune defense and modulation strategies. […] Particularly, immunomodulatory mechanisms employed by the placenta may mitigate violent immune response, maybe soften cytokine storm tightly associated with severely ill COVID-19 patients, possibly minimizing cell and tissue damages, and potentially reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

[…] This review summarises the available evidence of its transmission modes, our preliminary research findings and implications on infection control policy, and outlines future research directions. […] Transmission via environmental surfaces or fomites is likely, but decontamination protocols are effective in minimising this risk. […] The extent of airborne transmission is also unclear. […] Transmission likely lies on a spectrum between droplet to airborne transmission depending on patient, disease and environmental factors.

We found out that disease elimination is difficult when more asymptomatic individuals contribute in transmission or are not identified and isolated in a timely manner. […] However, maintaining a baseline level of asymptomatic isolation and a low transmission rate will lead to a significant reduction in the number of daily cases when the pandemic peaks. […] For example, at the baseline level of asymptomatic isolation, at least a 46% reduction in the transmission rate is required for disease elimination. […] Combining two or more measures is better for disease control, e.g., if asymptomatic cases are contact traced or identified and isolated in less than 8 days, only about 29% reduction in the disease transmission rate is required for disease elimination.

This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the current literature to determine estimates of vertical transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 based on early RNA detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 after birth from various neonatal or fetal sources and neonatal serology. […] Quantitative synthesis was performed on cohort or case series studies according to the neonatal biological specimen site to reach pooled proportions of vertical transmission. […] Our quantitative synthesis revealed that of 936 neonates from mothers with coronavirus disease 2019, 27 neonates had a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 viral RNA test using nasopharyngeal swab, indicating a pooled proportion of 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.2-4.3) for vertical transmission. […] Vertical transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is possible and seems to occur in a minority of cases of maternal coronavirus disease 2019 infection in the third trimester.

Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is highly infectious; however, the different routes of transmission are not well understood. […] Transmission through tissue transplantation is possible and must be considered. […] This review will evaluate the current literature regarding routes of transmission, the likelihood of transmission through ocular tissue transplantation, and the guidelines in place to mitigate this risk. […] Although respiratory droplets have been the primary route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there is evidence that transmission through blood donation and organ or tissue transplantation is possible. […] Based on the current literature and guidelines, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through corneal transplantation is likely low.

One of the mechanisms of airborne transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome - corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) amid humans is through direct ejection of droplets via sneezing, coughing and vocalizing. […] Through a critical review of the current literature and a preliminary analysis of the link between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and air pollution in the affected regions, we offer a perspective that polluted environment could enhance the transmission rate of such deadly viruses under moderate-to-high humidity conditions. […] The aqueous atmospheric aerosols offer a conducive surface for adsorption/absorption of organic molecules and viruses onto them, facilitating a pathway for higher rate of transmission under favourable environmental conditions. […] This mechanism partially explains the role of polluted air besides the exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases in the rapid transmission of the virus amongst the public.

This kind of question is appropriate for public health responses and it will depend on the early estimates of the key epidemiological parameters of the virus in a defined population.In this study, we combined a likelihood-based method using a Bayesian framework and compartmental model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Nigeria to estimate the effective reproduction number (R(t)) and basic reproduction number (R0) - this also enables us to estimate the initial daily transmission rate (β0).

[…] No secondary transmission occurred in nine of ten ECEC settings among 497 contacts. […] However, one outbreak in an ECEC setting involved transmission to six adults and seven children (attack rate 35·1%; 13/37). […] SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates were low in NSW educational settings during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave, consistent with mild infrequent disease in the 1·8 million child population. […] With effective case-contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers of attendances while infected, children and teachers did not contribute significantly to COVID-19 transmission via attendance in educational settings.

Currently available evidence supports that the predominant route of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 is through respiratory droplets and/or contact routes. […] The report by the World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China supports person-to-person droplet and fomite transmission during close unprotected contact with the vast majority of the investigated infection clusters occurring within families, with a household secondary attack rate varying between 3 and 10%, a finding that is not consistent with airborne transmission. […] The reproduction number (R0) for the SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be between 2.2-2.7, compatible with other respiratory viruses associated with a droplet/contact mode of transmission and very different than an airborne virus like measles with a R0 widely cited to be between 12 and 18.

Transmission parameters between compartments are typically estimated through stochastic parameterization processes that depends on detailed statistics of transmission characteristics, which are economically and resource-wise expensive to collect. […] We aim to apply deep learning techniques as a lower data dependency alternative to estimate transmission parameters of a customized compartmental model, for the purpose of simulating the dynamics of the US coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic and projecting its further development. […] We constructed a compartmental model and developed a multistep deep learning methodology to estimate the model’s transmission parameters. […] We then fed the estimated transmission parameters to the model to predict development of the US COVID-19 epidemic for 35 and 42 days. […] Current compartmental models require stochastic parameterization to estimate the transmission parameters.

The distribution of the transmission onset of COVID-19 relative to the symptom onset is a key parameter for infection control. […] It is often not easy to study the transmission onset time, as it is difficult to know who infected whom exactly when. […] We inferred transmission onset time from 72 infector-infectee pairs in South Korea, either with known or inferred contact dates, utilizing the incubation period. […] Combining this data with known information of the infector’s symptom onset, we could generate the transmission onset distribution of COVID-19, using Bayesian methods. […] We estimated the median transmission onset to be 1.31 days (standard deviation, 2.64 days) after symptom onset with a peak at 0.72 days before symptom onset. […] The pre-symptomatic transmission proportion was 37% (95% credible interval [CI], 16-52%). […] Considering that the transmission onset distribution peaked with the symptom onset and the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion is substantial, the usual preventive measures might be too late to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model based on temporal moving windows to quantify COVID-19 transmission patterns and compare the temporal progress of disease spread in six representative regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). […] Measure-dependent transmission rates followed a modified normal distribution (empirical law) in the three Chinese regions. […] Subsequent modeling simulations were based on the working assumption that similar infection transmission control measures were taken in South Korea as in Zhejiang on February 25th, in Italy as in Guangdong on February 25th, and in Iran as in Xinjiang on March 8th. […] The surface air temperature showed stronger association with transmission rate of COVID-19 than surface relative humidity.

National and international guidelines recommend droplet/airborne transmission and contact precautions for those caring for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in ambulatory and acute care settings. […] A recognized key to transmission of COVID-19, and droplet infections generally, is the dispersion of bioaerosols from the patient. […] Increased risk of transmission has been associated with aerosol generating procedures that include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. […] Taking actions to reduce risk of transmission to HCWs is, therefore, a vital consideration for safe delivery of all medical aerosols. […] Bioaerosols generated by infected patients are a major source of transmission for SARS CoV-2, and other infectious agents. […] In contrast, therapeutic aerosols do not add to the risk of disease transmission unless contaminated by patients or HCWs.

(Loder, 2020) There is little doubt that, when facing a pandemic with a high speed of onset and transmission, “nobody should be surprised that errors were made” (Adebowale et al, 2020) and “what it was done some weeks ago is not what we would do today”.

Previous research on respiratory infection transmission among university students has primarily focused on influenza. […] In this study, we explore potential transmission events for multiple respiratory pathogens in a social contact network of university students. […] We considered a transmission event to have occurred if students were positive for the same pathogen and had a network connection within a 14-day period. […] Five viruses were involved in 18 transmission events (influenza A, parainfluenza virus 3, rhinovirus, coronavirus NL63, respiratory syncytial virus). […] Identified transmission events had contacts reported in small classes (33%), dormitory common areas (22%) and dormitory rooms (17%). […] These results suggest that targeting person-to-person interactions, through measures such as isolation and quarantine, could reduce transmission of respiratory infections on campus.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severely threatens the public health worldwide, but the transmission mechanism and the effectiveness of mitigation measures remain uncertain. […] Here we assess the role of airborne transmission in spreading the disease and the effectiveness of face covering in preventing inter-human transmission for the top-fifteen infected U.S. states during March 1 and May 18, 2020. […] The linearity extends one to two months for the six states without mandated face covering and to the onset of mandated face covering for the other nine states with this measure, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between first-order transmission kinetics and intervention. […] The inadequacy of social distancing and stay-at-home measures alone in preventing inter-human transmission is reflected by the continuous linear growth in the total infection curve after implementing these measures, which is mainly driven by airborne transmission. […] We conclude that airborne transmission and face covering play the dominant role in spreading the disease and flattening the total infection curve, respectively. […] Our findings provide policymakers and the public with compelling evidence that universal face covering, in conjunction with social distancing and hand hygiene, represents the maximal protection against inter-human transmission and the combination of these intervention measures with rapid and extensive testing as well as contact tracing is crucial in containing the COVID-19 pandemic.

[…] The current article comprehensively reviews and discusses the current understanding about animal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 for their emergence, transmission, zoonotic potential, alteration of tissue/host tropism, evolution, status of vaccines and surveillance. […] This study aims at providing guidance for control of COVID-19 and preventative strategies for possible future outbreaks of zoonotic coronavirus via cross-species transmission.

We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31-February 19, 2020. […] Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4-15, 2020.

We aimed to investigate the potential impact of different testing and isolation strategies on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). […] We developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on infectiousness and PCR test sensitivity over time since infection. […] If all individuals with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 self-isolated and self-isolation was 100% effective in reducing onwards transmission, self-isolation of symptomatic individuals would result in a reduction in R of 47% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 32-55). […] Weekly screening of health-care workers and other high-risk groups irrespective of symptoms by use of PCR testing is estimated to reduce their contribution to SARS-CoV-2 transmission by 23% (95% UI 16-40), on top of reductions achieved by self-isolation following symptoms, assuming results are available at 24 h. […] Molecular testing can play an important role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially among health-care workers and other high-risk groups, but no single strategy will reduce R below 1 at current levels of population immunity.

This has spurred efforts to characterize the coronavirus and understand the factors impacting its transmission and survival such as aerosols, air quality, meteorology, chemical compositions and characteristics of particles and surfaces, which are directly or indirectly associated with coronaviruses infection spread. […] Nonetheless, many peer-reviewed articles have studied these aspects but mostly in isolation; a complete array of coronavirus survival and transmission from an infected individual through air- and water-borne channels and its subsequent intractions with environmental factors, surfaces, particulates and chemicals is not comprehensively explored. […] Learning from the earlier coronavirus studies, including SARS and MERS, an attempt has been made to understand the survival of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the host body and discuss the probable air and water-borne transmission routes and its interactions with the outside environment. […] The present work 1) Helps appreciate the role of PM, its chemical constituents and surface characteristics and 2) Further identifies gaps in this field and suggests possible domains to work upon for better understanding of transmission and survival of this novel coronavirus.

[…] The estimation outcomes indicate that Rc is 3.36 (95% CI: 3.20-3.64) and Re(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission.

We review the state of knowledge on the bio-fluid dynamic mechanisms involved in the transmission of the infection from SARS-CoV-2. […] The relevance of the subject stems from the key role of airborne virus transmission by viral particles released by an infected person via coughing, sneezing, speaking or simply breathing. […] A deeper understanding of the relevant biological fluid dynamics would also allow us to evaluate the contrasting effects of natural or forced ventilation of environments on the transmission of contagion: the risk decreases as the viral load is diluted by mixing effects but contagion is potentially allowed to reach larger distances from the infected source.

The objective of the study is to investigate the effects of transmission control efforts of the Philippine Government through implementation of Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) on curtailing the exponential growth of the Corona Virus (Covid-19). […] Also, this study provides forecast of transmission rate of Covid-19 incorporating the heterogeneous characteristics of the group of population according to age. […] The heterogeneous-mixing model was used to forecast the transmission rate of Covid-19 and effect of Enhanced Community Quarantine in various Local Government Units (LGUs) in the National Capital Region (NCR), Philippines. […] The result of the study revealed that the mobility of people has significant contribution to the transmission rate of Covid-19. […] The result of the study revealed that the mobilization of workers, who are exempted in ECQ, would greatly affect the transmission of disease to those who are in the senior citizen group. […] The increase in the confirmed cases of Covid-19 is associated with the transmission from those workers, who are exempted from ECQ to senior citizens and the young age group. […] This study concluded that in order to achieve the containment of the spread of Covid-19 in the Philippines, the government should be stricter in implementation of the ECQ and incorporate the different pattern of transmission of Covid-19 in deciding whether to extend or to lift the ECQ.

We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, [Formula: see text], below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. […] When calibrating our model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find [Formula: see text] Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters.

[…] During June-August 2020, four overnight camps in Maine implemented several NPIs to prevent and mitigate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including prearrival quarantine, pre- and postarrival testing and symptom screening, cohorting, use of face coverings, physical distancing, enhanced hygiene measures, cleaning and disinfecting, and maximal outdoor programming. […] Following isolation of these persons and quarantine of their contacts, no secondary transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred. […] These findings can inform similar multilayered public health strategies to prevent and mitigate the introduction and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among children, adolescents, and adults in congregate settings, such as overnight camps, residential schools, and colleges.

[…] Despite of the evidence, based on fewer reports on SARS-CoV-2 occurrence and persistence in wastewater/sewage/water, the transmission of the infective virus to the community is yet to be established. […] In this realm, this communication attempted to review the possible influx route of the enteric enveloped viral transmission in the environmental settings with reference to its occurrence, persistence, detection, and inactivation based on the published literature so far. […] The possibilities of airborne transmission through enteric virus-laden aerosols, environmental factors that may influence the viral transmission, and disinfection methods (conventional and emerging) as well as the inactivation mechanism with reference to the enveloped virus were reviewed.

The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. […] Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. […] Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. […] Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. […] SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. […] Future research directions on COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission are highlighted.

[…] Child-to-child transmission in schools/childcare facilities appeared very uncommon. […] We anticipate that, with face mask use and frequent ventilation of rooms, transmission rates in schools/childcare facilities would remain low in the next term, even if classes’ group sizes were increased.

SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is suspected to have been first contracted via animal-human interactions; it has further spread across the world by efficient human-to-human transmission. […] Recent reports of COVID-19 in companion animals (dogs and cats) and wild carnivores such as tigers have created a dilemma regarding its zoonotic transmission. […] Although in silico docking studies, sequence-based computational studies, and experimental studies have shown the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in cats, ferrets, and other domestic/wild animals, the results are not conclusive of infection under natural conditions. […] Identifying the potential host range of SARS-CoV-2 will not only help prevent the possibility of human-to-animal and animal-to-human transmission but also assist in identifying efficient animal models that can mimic the clinical symptoms, transmission potential, and pathogenesis of the disease.

The widespread outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 has raised numerous questions about the origin and transmission of the virus. […] Knowledge about the mode of transmission as well as assessing the effectiveness of the preventive measures would aid in containing the outbreak of the coronavirus. […] Presently, respiratory droplets, physical contact and aerosols/air-borne have been reported as the modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission of the virus. […] Besides, some of the other possible modes of transmission are being explored by the researchers, with some studies suggesting the viral spread through fecal-oral, conjunctival secretions, flatulence (farts), sexual and vertical transmission from mother to the fetus, and through asymptomatic carriers, etc. […] Aim: The primary objective was to review the present understanding and knowledge about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and also to suggest recommendations in containing and preventing the novel coronavirus. […] A review of possible modes of transmission of the novel SARS-CoV-2 was conducted based on the reports and articles available in PubMed and ScienceDirect.com that were searched using keywords, ‘transmission’, ‘modes of transmission’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘novel coronavirus’, and ‘COVID-19’. […] Articles referring to air-borne, conjunctiva, fecal-oral, maternal-fetal, flatulence (farts), and breast milk transmission were included, while the remaining were excluded. […] The modes of transmission linked to SARS-CoV-2 were identified and the available literature on each of these is described in detail in view of the possibilities of viral transmission through various modes of transmission. […] The review provides updated and necessary information on the possible modes of transmission for the health care workers and the lay public under one umbrella that can also be considered during framing guidelines in order to prevent and control the viral spread.

[…] While the whole world is investigating the possibility about the transmission of this virus, the transmission among humans is established, but the interface between humans and animals is not much evident.

[…] Moreover, the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; considering the high contagion and a long latent period associated with this virus, the onus is upon each individual surgeon to decide if one needs evidence of bioaerosol-based transmission or evidence in favor of safety before taking up ‘laparoscopy’ against ‘open surgery’.

[…] Transmission was documented from these children to at least 12 (26%) of 46 nonfacility contacts (confirmed or probable cases). […] Transmission was observed from two of three children with confirmed, asymptomatic COVID-19. […] Detailed contact tracing data show that children can play a role in transmission from child care settings to household contacts. […] Having SARS-CoV-2 testing available, timely results, and testing of contacts of persons with COVID-19 in child care settings regardless of symptoms can help prevent transmission. […] CDC guidance for child care programs recommends the use of face masks, particularly among staff members, especially when children are too young to wear masks, along with hand hygiene, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of high-touch surfaces, and staying home when ill to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission (4).

Contact tracing data could also be potentially used for assessing the heterogeneity of transmission at the individual patient level. […] Standard social network analysis methods used for exploring infectious disease transmission dynamics was employed to analyze contact tracing data of 1959 diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 patients from a large state of India. […] Network measures of " degree centrality" and “betweenness centrality” were calculated to identify influential patients in the transmission of infection. […] Betweenness centrality measures highlighted that 7.50% (93) patients had a non-zero betweenness (range 0.5 to 135) and thus have bridged the transmission between other patients. […] Social network analysis method for SARS-CoV-2 contact tracing data would be of use in measuring individual patient level variations in disease transmission. […] The network metrics identified individual patients and patient components who have disproportionately contributed to transmission.

For SARS-CoV-2, the degree to which SSEs are involved in transmission remains unclear, but there is growing evidence that SSEs might be a typical feature of COVID-197,8. […] We identified 4-7 SSEs across 51 clusters (n = 309 cases) and estimated that 19% (95% confidence interval, 15-24%) of cases seeded 80% of all local transmission. […] Transmission in social settings was associated with more secondary cases than households when controlling for age (P = 0.002). […] Decreasing the delay between symptom onset and case confirmation did not result in fewer secondary cases (P = 0.98), although the odds that an individual being quarantined as a contact interrupted transmission was 14.4 (95% CI, 1.9-107.2). […] Public health authorities should focus on rapidly tracing and quarantining contacts, along with implementing restrictions targeting social settings to reduce the risk of SSEs and suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Here, we applied whole virus genome sequencing (WvGS) to analyse transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital-acquired (HA) COVID-19. […] WvGS identified transmission events previously undetected by epidemiological analysis and provided evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between healthcare workers (HCW) and patients and among HCW themselves. […] The majority of HA COVID-19 cases occurred in patients highly dependent on nursing care, suggesting the likely route of transmission was by close contact or droplet, rather than aerosol, transmission. […] This study provides evidence that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs from symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs to patients. […] Interventions including comprehensive screening of HCWs for COVID-19 symptoms, PCR testing of asymptomatic HCWs upon identification of HA cases and implementation of universal use of surgical masks for all clinical care is indicated to prevent viral transmission. […] Our study highlights the importance of close collaboration between guidance bodies and frontline IPC experts for developing control measures in an emergency pandemic situation caused by a virus with undefined transmission modus.

Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: 1) “mitigation,” which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and 2) “suppression,” aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. […] Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterized to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the United Kingdom, we assessed the long-term prospects of success using both of these approaches. […] Our modeling confirmed that suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is possible with plausible levels of social distancing over a period of months, consistent with observed trends. […] Specifically, we found that 1) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, 2) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be adaptive over time in a precise yet unfeasible way, and 3) social distancing must be maintained for an extended period to ensure the healthcare system is not overwhelmed.

In this paper, we use a stochastic epidemic SIRC model, with cross-immune class and time-delay in transmission terms, for the spread of COVID-19. […] Our findings show that white noise plays an important part in controlling the spread of the disease; When the white noise is relatively large, the infectious diseases will become extinct; Re-infection and periodic outbreaks can occur due to the existence of feedback time-delay (or memory) in the transmission terms.

Given these characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the absence of reported transfusion transmission (TT), the TT risk is currently theoretical. […] To mitigate any potential TT risk, but more importantly to prevent respiratory transmission in donor centres, blood centres can implement donor deferral policies based on travel, disease status or potential risk of exposure.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, formulating targeted policy interventions that are informed by differential severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission dynamics will be of vital importance to national and regional governments. […] We develop an individual-level model for SARS-CoV-2 transmission that accounts for location-dependent distributions of age, household structure, and comorbidities. […] We also examine the role of transmission due to particular age groups on total infections and deaths. […] The effect of limiting contacts by a particular age group varies by location, indicating that strategies to reduce transmission should be tailored based on population-specific demography and social structure. […] Across the three populations, though, we find that targeted “salutary sheltering” by 50% of a single age group may substantially curtail transmission when combined with the adoption of physical distancing measures by the rest of the population.

To assess the impact of the declaration, this study used population-level questionnaire data collected from an SNS with 121,375 respondents (between March 27 and May 5) to assess the change in transmission routes over the study period, which was measured by investigating the association between COVID-19-related symptoms and (self-reported) contact with COVID-19-infected individuals. […] While careful interpretation is necessary because our data are self-reported from voluntary SNS users, these findings indicate the impact of the declaration on the change in transmission routes of COVID-19 over time in Japan.

Transmission electron microscopy has become a valuable tool to investigate tissues of COVID-19 patients because it allows visualisation of SARS-CoV-2, but the “virus-like particles” described in several organs have been highly contested.

In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. […] Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%.

Due to the unobservability, the time interval between transmission generations (TG), though important for understanding the disease transmission patterns, of COVID-19 cannot be directly summarized from surveillance data. […] In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the TG and the pre-symptomatic transmission period from the serial interval observations from the individual transmission events. […] As the results, we estimate the mean of TG at 4.0 days (95%CI: 3.3-4.6), and the mean of pre-symptomatic transmission period at 2.2 days (95%CI: 1.3-4.7). […] We approximate the mean latent period of 3.3 days, and 32.2% (95%CI: 10.3-73.7) of the secondary infections may be due to pre-symptomatic transmission.

The concept of controlling disease transmission relies on contacts suppression; and on the longer end, relies on vaccinations. […] Recent evidence outlines test, tracing and isolation are effective in suppressing COVID-19 transmission. […] Minimizing testing and tracing delay, less than four days with coverage of 80% close contacts could prevent and reduce onwards transmission.That we need to more is indisputable.

Isolation space must be expanded during pandemics involving airborne transmission.

[…] The overall goal was to minimize disease transmission between residents and staff within the facility. […] We measured pressure on-site and performed computational fluid dynamics and Lagrangian particle-based modeling to test containment and possible transmission extent given the isolation space is considered negative rather than individual rooms. […] No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between residents isolated to the space occurred, nor did any transmission to the staff or other residents occur. […] Skilled nursing facilities can be retrofitted to provide negative pressure isolation space in a reasonable time frame and a cost effective manner to minimize airborne disease transmission within that space.

Transmission mechanics of infectious pathogen in various environments are of great complexity and has always been attracting many researchers’ attention. […] Besides, with the development of computer science, an increasing number of researchers start to analyze pathogen transmission by using CFD methods. […] Inspired by the impact of COVID-19, this review summarizes research works of pathogen transmission based on CFD methods with different models and algorithms. […] A series of investigations which analyzed pathogen transmission in different environments (hospital, teaching building, etc) demonstrated the effect of airflow on pathogen transmission and emphasized the importance of reasonable ventilation. […] Although CFD methods mentioned in this review may not alleviate the current pandemic situation, it helps researchers realize the transmission mechanisms of pathogens like viruses and bacteria and provides guidelines for reducing infection risk in epidemic or pandemic situations.

In this review, we have discussed the pathobiology of COVID-19 in the lungs and brain and the role of ACE2 in the transmission and pathobiology of this disease. […] Further, we have shown possible interactions between nicotine/smoking and ACE2 in the lungs and brain which could aggravate the transmission and pathobiology of COVID-19 resulting in a poor disease outcome. […] It adds to the time-sensitive and critically important growing knowledge about the risk factors, transmission, pathobiology, and prognosis of COVID-19.

BackgroundThe natural history of disease in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remained obscure during the early pandemic.AimOur objective was to estimate epidemiological parameters of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and assess the relative infectivity of the incubation period.MethodsWe estimated the distributions of four epidemiological parameters of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a large database of COVID-19 cases and potential transmission pairs of cases, and assessed their heterogeneity by demographics, epidemic phase and geographical region. […] Peak infectivity occurred 1 day before symptom onset on average, and the incubation period accounted for 70% of transmission.ConclusionThe high infectivity during the incubation period led to short generation and serial intervals, necessitating aggressive control measures such as early case finding and quarantine of close contacts.

[…] The Guidelines of the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA), Global Alliance of Eye Bank Associations (GAEBA) and European Association of Tissue Banks provide useful recommendations to eliminate the risk of transmission according to previous experiences based on similar viruses.

Determining multiple transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical to improving safety practices for the public and stemming the spread of SARS-CoV-2 effectively. […] This article mainly focuses on published studies on the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 including contact transmission, droplet transmission, aerosol transmission and fecal-oral transmission, as well as related research approaches, such as epidemiological investigations, environmental sampling in hospitals and laboratories and animal models. […] Third, background monitoring of the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms and environmental disinfection in crowded public places, such as railway stations, schools, hospitals and other densely populated areas, can give early warning of outbreaks and curb the transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 in those high-risk areas. […] Forth, establishing novel predictive models can help us to not only assess transmission and impacts in communities, but also better implement corresponding emergency response measures.

Although airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from person-to-person over long distances is currently thought to be unlikely, the current epidemiological evidence suggests that airborne SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission in confined, indoor spaces is plausible, particularly when outdoor airflow rates are low and when face masks are not utilized. […] We sought to model airborne infection transmission risk assuming five realistic exposure scenarios using previously estimated outdoor airflow rates for 12 New York City nail salons, a published quanta generation rate specific to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the Wells-Riley equation to assess risk under both steady-state and non-steady-state conditions. […] Additionally, the impact of face mask-wearing by occupants on airborne infection transmission risk was also evaluated. […] The risk of airborne infection transmission across all salons and all exposure scenarios when not wearing face masks ranged from &lt;0.015% to 99.25%, with an average airborne infection transmission risk of 24.77%. […] Wearing face masks reduced airborne infection transmission risk to between &lt;0.01% and 51.96%, depending on the salon, with an average airborne infection transmission risk of 7.30% across all salons. […] Increased outdoor airflow rates in nail salons were generally strongly correlated with decreased average airborne infection transmission risk. […] The results of this study indicate that increased outdoor airflow rates and the use of face masks by both employees and customers could substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York City nail salons. […] Businesses should utilize multiple layers of infection control measures (e.g. social distancing, face masks, and outdoor airflow) to reduce airborne infection transmission risk for both employees and customers.

These passive modes of infection transmission remain an unexplored area for traditional mean-field epidemic models. […] Here, we design an agent-based model for simulations of infection transmission in an open system driven by the dynamics of social activity; the model takes into account the personal characteristics of individuals, as well as the survival time of the virus and its potential mutations. […] The simulated processes underpin the latent infection transmissions, contributing significantly to the spread of the virus within a large time window. […] On the other hand, virus mutations that can gradually reduce the transmission rate by hopping to each new host along the infection path can significantly reduce the extent of the infection, but can not stop the spreading without additional social strategies.

A key consideration in the Covid-19 pandemic is the dominant modes of transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. […] The objective of this review was to synthesise the evidence for the potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols. […] Seven out of eight epidemiological studies suggest aerosol transmission may occur, with enclosed environments and poor ventilation noted as possible contextual factors. […] Epidemiological studies suggest possible transmission, with contextual factors noted. […] However, there is uncertainty as to the nature and impact of aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and its relative contribution to the Covid-19 pandemic compared with other modes of transmission.

[…] We conclude that the available body of scientific evidence on the coronavirus disease 2019 holds the key to the development of such strategies and interventions.Going forward, we recommend that the African research community should scale up research to provide scientific evidence for a better characterization of the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, prevention and control of the virus on the continent.

[…] Five significant risk factors, which were exposed to a source of transmission (9 points), cluster onset (6 points), history of fever or temperature higher than 37.2 °C on admission (4 points), cough (1 point) and other atypical symptoms (1 point), were ultimately selected from many candidates to construct the new rapid COVID-19 screening program.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been intense debate over SARS-CoV-2’s mode of transmission and appropriate personal protective equipment for health care workers in low-risk settings. […] The objective of this review is to identify and appraise the available evidence (clinical trials and laboratory studies on masks and respirators, epidemiological studies, and air sampling studies), clarify key concepts and necessary conditions for airborne transmission, and shed light on knowledge gaps in the field. […] We find that, except for aerosol-generating procedures, the overall data in support of airborne transmission-taken in its traditional definition (long-distance and respirable aerosols)-are weak, based predominantly on indirect and experimental rather than clinical or epidemiological evidence.

This decision analytical model used a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission, stratified by age and risk group, with construction workers modeled explicitly. […] Based on 500 stochastic simulations for each of 15 scenarios that varied the size of the construction workforce and level of worksite transmission risk, the association between continued construction work and hospitalizations was estimated and then compared with anonymized line-list hospitalization data from central Texas through August 20, 2020. […] Social distancing interventions, size of construction workforce, and level of disease transmission at construction worksites. […] This increased risk was estimated to be offset by safety measures (such as thorough cleaning of equipment between uses, wearing of protective equipment, limits on the number of workers at a worksite, and increased health surveillance) that were associated with a 50% decrease in transmission. […] The findings of this study suggest that unrestricted work in high-contact industries, such as construction, is associated with a higher level of community transmission, increased risks to at-risk workers, and larger health disparities among members of racial and ethnic minority groups.

[…] If lockdown-related disruptions cause a temporary 50% reduction in TB transmission, we estimated that a 3-month suspension of TB services, followed by 10 months to restore to normal, would cause, over the next 5 years, an additional 1⋅19 million TB cases (Crl 1⋅06-1⋅33) and 361,000 TB deaths (CrI 333-394 thousand) in India, 24,700 (16,100-44,700) TB cases and 12,500 deaths (8.8-17.8 thousand) in Kenya, and 4,350 (826-6,540) cases and 1,340 deaths (815-1,980) in Ukraine.

Superspreaders, infected individuals who result in an outsized number of secondary cases, are believed to underlie a significant fraction of total SARS-CoV-2 transmission. […] Here, we combine empirical observations of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 transmission and extreme value statistics to show that the distribution of secondary cases is consistent with being fat-tailed, implying that large superspreading events are extremal, yet probable, occurrences. […] We integrate these results with interaction-based network models of disease transmission and show that superspreading, when it is fat-tailed, leads to pronounced transmission by increasing dispersion.

This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. […] Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. […] Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy. […] However, specific standards for indoor environmental quality control have not been recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in closed indoor spaces.

First, there could be super-spreaders in these distributions/networks and second, the Pareto principle could be valid in these distributions/networks regarding estimation that 20% of cases were responsible for 80% of local transmission. […] When we accept that these two points are valid, the distribution of transmission becomes a discrete Pareto distribution, which is a kind of power law. […] Having such a transmission distribution, then we can simulate COVID-19 networks and find super-spreaders using the centricity measurements in these networks. […] In this research, in the first we transformed a transmission distribution of statistics and epidemiology into a transmission network of network science and second we try to determine who the super-spreaders are by using this network and eigenvalue centrality measure. […] We underline that determination of transmission probability distribution is a very important point in the analysis of the epidemic and determining the precautions to be taken.

This methodology has been used to supplement contact tracing investigations for tuberculosis and to understand how social networks contribute to transmission of sexually transmitted infections (3-5).

[…] The observed connections among detained persons with COVID-19 were significantly lower than expected (1.0% versus 1.1%, p&lt;0.001) when considering only the housing units in which initial transmission occurred, suggesting that the systematic isolation of persons with COVID-19 is effective at limiting transmission.

The proportion of asymptomatic carriers and transmission risk factors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among household and non-household contacts remains unclear. […] In Singapore, extensive contact tracing by the Ministry of Health for every diagnosed COVID-19 case, and legally enforced quarantine and intensive health surveillance of close contacts provided a rare opportunity to determine asymptomatic attack rates and SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors among community close contacts of patients with COVID-19. […] Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk factors. […] Sharing a bedroom (multivariable odds ratio [OR] 5·38 [95% CI 1·82-15·84]; p=0·0023) and being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (7·86 [3·86-16·02]; p&lt;0·0001) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household contacts. […] Among non-household contacts, exposure to more than one case (multivariable OR 3·92 [95% CI 2·07-7·40], p&lt;0·0001), being spoken to by an index case for 30 min or longer (2·67 [1·21-5·88]; p=0·015), and sharing a vehicle with an index case (3·07 [1·55-6·08]; p=0·0013) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Fecal-oral transmission is considered also as a potential route of transmission since several scientists confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces of infected patients, therefore its transmission via feces in aquatic environment, particularly hospital wastewater. […] The knowledge of the detection and survival of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater and hospital wastewater were described to understand the different routes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which is also useful to avoid the outbreak of CoV-19.

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 occurs through exhaled respiratory droplets from infected humans. […] Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission.

[…] We assess the reverse-zoonotic transmission risk to Antarctic wildlife by considering the available information on host susceptibility, dynamics of the infection in humans, and contact interactions between humans and Antarctic wildlife. […] Indoor spaces such as those at research stations, research vessels or tourist cruise ships could allow for more transmission among humans and depending on their movements between different locations the virus could be spread across the continent. […] Field researchers handling animals are identified as the human group posing the highest risk of transmission to animals while tourists and other personnel pose a significant risk only when in close proximity (&lt; 5 m) to Antarctic fauna.

[…] Surfaces could not be touched by patients or health workers, so viral spreading was unequivocally produced by air transmission. […] Thus, fomites should be considered as a possible mode of transmission of coronavirus and frequent disinfection of surfaces should be taken into account.

[…] The third cluster involved only 2 employees with possible transmission while working in the same office at the same time. […] No nosocomial transmission to patients transpired. […] To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hospital-based cluster of COVID-19 infections among HCWs in a cancer hospital describing our steps to mitigate further transmission.

The goals of this review are to identify the in-flight transmission risks of commercial air travel, provide recommendations about the risks of flying during the pandemic and propose strategies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. […] Proximity to an index case may contribute to the risk of transmission more than the seat type or location. […] The use of face masks has significantly reduced onboard transmission, and mandatory in-flight mask-wearing policies are being enforced. […] In-flight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a real risk, which may be minimized by combining mitigation strategies and infection prevention measures including mandatory masking onboard, minimizing unmasked time while eating, turning on gasper airflow in-flight, frequent hand sanitizing, disinfecting high touch surfaces, promoting distancing while boarding and deplaning, limiting onboard passenger movement, implementing effective pre-flight screening measures and enhancing contact tracing capability.

[…] Although the risk of in-flight transmission is considered to be very low, estimated at one case per 27 million travellers, confirmed in-flight cases have been published.

In this present study, we have considered a SAIRS epidemiological model on COVID-19 transmission where people in the susceptible environment move into asymptotically exposed class after coming contact with asymptotically exposed, symptomatically infected and even hospitalised people. […] The numerical study indicates that if more people from asymptotically exposed class move into quarantine class to prevent further virus transmission, then the infected population decreases significantly. […] Numerical figures show that the control strategy, which denotes the social distancing to reduce disease transmission, works with a higher intensity almost after one month of implementation and then decreases in the last few days. […] Therefore, implementing control policies may help to reduce the disease transmission at this current pandemic situation as these controls reduce the overall infected population and increase the recovered population.

[…] Furthermore, some studies have pointed out other modes of virus transmission, such as person to person, and direct contact with animals. […] Droplet and contact with contaminated surfaces were the most frequent transmission modes of COVID-19. […] Fecal excretion, environmental contamination, and fluid pollution might contribute to a viral transmission.

[…] The principal sources and routes of potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in water systems are hospital sewage, waste from isolation and quarantine centres, faecal-oral transmission, contaminated surface and groundwater sources, and contaminated sewage. […] The envisioned overwhelming impact of these sources on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through water systems in Africa suggests that governments need to put stringent and sustainable measures to curtail the scourge.

In addition to prevalence of observed daily and cumulative testing, testing positivity rates, morbidity, and mortality, we derived COVID-19 transmission in terms of speed, acceleration or deceleration, change in acceleration or deceleration (jerk), and 7-day transmission rate persistence, which explains where and how rapidly COVID-19 is transmitting and quantifies shifts in the rate of acceleration or deceleration to inform policies to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 and food insecurity in SSA. […] In September 2020, Cape Verde, Namibia, Eswatini, and South Africa had the highest speed of COVID-19 transmissions at 13.1, 7.1, 3.6, and 3 infections per 100,0000, respectively; Zimbabwe had an acceleration rate of transmission, while Zambia had the largest rate of deceleration this week compared to last week, referred to as a jerk. […] This change represents a decrease in the transmission model R value for that week and is consistent with a de-escalation in the pandemic for the sub-Saharan African continent in general. […] Standard surveillance metrics such as daily observed new COVID-19 cases or deaths are necessary but insufficient to mitigate and prevent COVID-19 transmission. […] Public health leaders also need to know where COVID-19 transmission rates are accelerating or decelerating, whether those rates increase or decrease over short time frames because the pandemic can quickly escalate, and how many cases today are a function of new infections 7 days ago. […] Even though SSA is home to some of the poorest countries in the world, development and population size are not necessarily predictive of COVID-19 transmission, meaning higher income countries like the United States can learn from African countries on how best to implement mitigation and prevention efforts.

Motivated by the importance of individual differences in risk perception and behavior change in people’s responses to infectious disease outbreaks (particularly the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we propose a heterogeneous disease-behavior-information transmission model, in which people’s risk of getting infected is influenced by information diffusion, behavior change, and disease transmission. […] Information diffusion influences behavior change by allowing people to be aware of the disease and adopt self-protection and subsequently affects disease transmission by changing the actual infection rate.

Although decreases in population density and surges in the public’s usage of personal protective equipment can mitigate direct transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), indirect transmission of the virus is still probable. […] By summarizing the current state of knowledge on the stability of coronaviruses on dry materials, this review uncovers the high potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contaminated surfaces (i.e., fomites) and prompts future research. […] Sunlight may rapidly inactivate the virus, suggesting that indirect transmission predominantly occurs indoors.

Because of SARS-CoV-2’s apparent evolutionary origins in bats and reports of humans transmitting the virus to pets and zoo animals, regulations for the prevention of human-to-animal transmission have so far focused mostly on these animal groups. […] Preventing human-to-wildlife SARS-CoV-2 transmission is important to protect these animals (some of which are classed as threatened) from disease, but also to avoid establishment of novel SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs in wild mammals. […] During such activities, we recommend sanitary precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing face masks and gloves, and frequent decontamination, which are very similar to regulations currently imposed to prevent transmission among humans.

A long-standing question in infectious disease dynamics concerns the role of transmission heterogeneities, which are driven by demography, behavior, and interventions. […] On the basis of detailed patient and contact-tracing data in Hunan, China, we find that 80% of secondary infections traced back to 15% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primary infections, which indicates substantial transmission heterogeneities. […] Transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions and is modulated by demographic and clinical factors. […] The lockdown period increases transmission risk in the family and households, whereas isolation and quarantine reduce risks across all types of contacts. […] Modeling indicates that SARS-CoV-2 control requires the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level interventions because of the specific transmission kinetics of this virus.

Transmission modes of the novel coronavirus have become a hot topic of research with the importance of airborne transmission controversial due to the many factors that can influence virus transmission. […] Airborne transmission is an accepted potential route for the spread of some viral infections (measles, chickenpox); however, aerosol features and infectious inoculum vary from one respiratory virus to another. […] Infectious virus-laden aerosols can be produced by natural human respiratory activities, and their features are vital determinants for virus carriage and transmission. […] Physicochemical characteristics of infectious respiratory aerosols can influence the efficiency of virus transmission by droplets. […] Further studies are therefore required to provide supporting evidence for the role of airborne transmission and assumed mechanisms underlying seasonality.

Airborne virus transmission occurs through droplets formed during respiratory events (breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing) associated with the airflow through a network of nasal and buccal passages. […] The model measures the transmission risk utilizing an approximated upper respiratory tract geometry for the following variations: (1) the effect of saliva properties and (2) the effect of geometric features within the buccal/nasal passages. […] Alternatively, when the viscosity of the saliva is increased (consistent with the human response to illness), the number of droplets is both fewer and larger, which leads to an estimated 47% reduction in the transmission risk. […] Such factors may partly relate to how the immune system of a human has evolved to prevent transmission or be an underlying factor driving superspreading events in the COVID-19 pandemic.

[…] From an ecological perspective, our model highlights the potential for environmental transmission to drive complex, nonlinear dynamics during infectious disease outbreaks. […] Summarizing, we propose that fitting alternative models with indirect transmission to real outbreak data from SARS-CoV-2 can be useful, as it highlights that indirect mechanisms may play an underappreciated role in the dynamics of infectious diseases, with implications for public health.

While risk of outdoor transmission of respiratory viral infections is hypothesized to be low, there is limited data of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in outdoor compared to indoor settings. […] We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed papers indexed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science and pre-prints in Europe PMC through August 12 th, 2020 that described cases of human transmission of SARS-CoV-2. […] Reports of other respiratory virus transmission were included for reference. […] Five identified studies found that a low proportion of reported global SARS-CoV-2 infections have occurred outdoors (&lt;10%) and the odds of indoor transmission was very high compared to outdoors (18.7 times; 95% CI 6.0, 57.9). […] Five studies described influenza transmission outdoors and two described adenovirus transmission outdoors. […] There was high heterogeneity in study quality and individual definitions of outdoor settings which limited our ability to draw conclusions about outdoor transmission risks. […] Existing evidence supports the wide-held belief that the the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is lower outdoors but there are significant gaps in our understanding of specific pathways.

Epidemiological data were analyzed for 183 confirmed COVID-19 cases and their close contacts from five generations of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 throughout the entire COVID-19 outbreak in Wanzhou. […] Asymptomatic and presymptomatic transmission accounted for 75.9% of the total recorded transmission. […] The reproductive number was 1.64 (95% confidence interval: 1.16-2.40) for G1-to-G2 transmission, decreasing to 0.31-0.39 in later generations, concomitant with implementation of rigorous control measures. […] The spread of COVID-19 was effectively controlled in Wanzhou by breaking the transmission chain through social distancing, extensive contact tracing, mass testing and strict quarantine of close contacts.

[…] In the cases of healthcare transmission, the patient was reportedly asymptomatic 32% of the time.

Widespread transmission of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has caused major public health and economic problems around the world. […] Significant mitigation efforts have been implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 but the role of ambient noise and elevated vocal effort on airborne transmission have not been widely reported. […] Multiple confirmed clusters of COVID-19 transmission were associated with settings where elevated vocal effort is generally required for communication, often due to high ambient noise levels, including crowded bars and restaurants, meat packing facilities, and long-stay nursing homes. […] Clusters of COVID-19 transmission have been frequently reported in each of these settings. […] Therefore, analysis of COVID-19 transmission clusters in different settings should consider whether higher ambient noise levels, which are associated with increased vocal effort, may be a contributing factor in those settings.

A major difficulty in the analysis of Covid-19 transmission is that many infected individuals are asymptomatic. […] In this paper, we consider a parametric time varying Markov process of Coronavirus transmission and show how to estimate the model parameters and approximate the unobserved counts from daily data on infected and detected individuals and the total daily death counts.

Following evidence of viral loadings and infectivity of feces of infected individuals, public health authorities have suggested to take precautions on the transmission of COVID-19 via fecal-associated routes. […] Recent discussions on fecal transmission of COVID-19 have mainly focused on municipal sewage. […] Here, we review fecal transmission of COVID-19, the practices of open defecation, and the resultant routes of transmission of fecal pathogens. […] We illustrate the potential routes of transmission of COVID-19 and other fecal pathogens via human feces in communities practicing open defecation. […] Here, poor hand hygiene, contaminated shoes and objects, mechanical vectors, and outdoor human activities can all contribute to fecal transmission.

Instead of modelling specific intervention types and timings for each country explicitly, we adopt a stochastic epidemiological model including a feedback mechanism on virus transmission to capture complex nonlinear dynamics arising from continuous changes in community behaviour in response to rising case numbers. […] Countries with the largest cumulative case tallies are characterised by a delayed response, whereas countries that avoid substantial community transmission during the period of study responded quickly.

We used a stochastic, individual-based model to simulate transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along detailed inter-individual contact networks describing patient-staff interactions in a real LTCF setting. […] In the baseline scenario, randomly introducing a silent SARS-CoV-2 infection into a 170-bed LTCF led to large outbreaks, with a cumulative 86 (95% uncertainty interval 6-224) infections after 3 weeks of unmitigated transmission. […] Efficacy of symptom-based screening was limited by lags to symptom onset and silent asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. […] At high testing capacity (&gt; 10 tests/100 beds/day), cascades were most effective, with a 19-36% probability of detecting outbreaks prior to any nosocomial transmission, and 26-46% prior to first onset of COVID-19 symptoms. […] Increasing testing capacity and updating surveillance protocols accordingly could facilitate earlier detection of emerging outbreaks, informing a need for urgent intervention in settings with ongoing nosocomial transmission.

[…] Nine studies on social distancing intervention demonstrated the importance of physical distance through closure of learning institutions on the transmission dynamics of disease.

We reviewed multiple aspects of COVID peri-pandemic air travel, including data on traveller numbers, peri-flight prevention, and testing recommendations and in-flight SARS-CoV-2 transmission, photo-epidemiology of mask use, the pausing of air travel to mass gathering events, and quarantine measures and their effectiveness. […] Although the risk of in-flight transmission is considered to be very low, estimated at one case per 27 million travellers, confirmed in-flight cases have been published. […] Quarantine of travellers may delay introduction or re-introduction of the virus, or may delay the peak of transmission, but the effect is small and there is limited evidence.

Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. […] Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test-and-trace strategies, is pivotal to reducing the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. […] When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban-rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. […] Our results emphasize the importance of test-and-trace strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.

Using a stochastic model, we assess the risk of importation-induced local transmission chains in locations seeing few or no local transmissions and evaluate the role of quarantine in the mitigation of this risk. […] We find that the rate of importations plays a critical role in determining the risk that case importations lead to local transmission chains, more so than local transmission characteristics, i.e. strength of social distancing measures (NPI). […] Locations that see no or low-level local transmission should ensure that the rate of importations remains low.

There is a concerted effort within the global scientifi c community to identify (and thereby potentially mitigate) the possible modes of transmission through which the virus spreads throughout populations. […] EVIDENCE AQUISITION We conducted an extensive literature search using electronic databases for scientifi c articles addressing SARSCoV-2 transmission published from December 28, 2019 through July 31, 2020. […] The report captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) viral survival, 2) transmission period and transmissibility, and 3) routes of viral spread. […] Temperature and humidity are important factors infl uencing viral survival and transmission. […] The basic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets, or via indirect contact. […] Aerosolized transmission is likely the dominant route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in healthcare facilities. […] Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood and breast milk, their role in transmission remains uncertain. […] A complicating factor in disease control is viral transmission by asymptomatic individuals and through what would otherwise be understood as innocuous human activities. […] CONCLUSIONS This article provides a review of the published research regarding human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and insights into developing effective control strategies to stop viral propagation.

In this paper, a novel stochastic model was proposed aiming to account for the unique transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and capture the effects of intervention measures implemented in Mainland China. […] We found that: (1) instead of aberration, there was a remarkable amount of asymptomatic virus carriers, (2) a virus carrier with symptoms was approximately twice more likely to pass the disease to others than that of an asymptomatic virus carrier, (3) the transmission rate reduced significantly since the implementation of control measures in Mainland China, and (4) it was expected that the epidemic outbreak would be contained by early March in the selected provinces and cities in China.

We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. […] These results are relevant to disease transmission during evacuations stemming from additional climate-related hazards such as wildfires and floods.

[…] This summary guidance highlights critical evidence-based CDC recommendations and sustainable strategies to reduce COVID-19 transmission. […] In combination, these strategies can reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, long-term sequelae or disability, and death, and mitigate the pandemic’s economic impact.

[…] RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 event rates and case rates were calculated for staff and students, and direction of transmission was inferred on the basis of symptom onset and testing dates. […] Probable direction of transmission was staff to staff in 26 outbreaks, staff to student in eight outbreaks, student to staff in 16 outbreaks, and student to student in five outbreaks. […] The strong association with regional COVID-19 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. […] Interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff.

However, virus genome sequence data is sparse and there has been only limited investigation of virus transmission across the country. […] Phylogenetic analysis including global sequence data revealed multiple independent introductions into Italy, with at least 124 instances of sequence clusters representing longer chains of transmission. […] Eighteen of these transmission clusters emerged before the nation-wide lockdown was implemented on 8 March, and an additional 18 had evidence for transmission between different Italian regions. […] Extended transmission periods between infections of up to 104 days were observed in five clusters.

We used Bayesian model comparison to revisit these conclusions, allowing for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. […] Bayesian model comparison furnished overwhelming evidence for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission. […] Furthermore, both lockdown and the build-up of population immunity contributed to viral transmission in all but one country. […] In summary, accounting for heterogeneity of exposure, susceptibility and transmission suggests that the next wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be much smaller than conventional models predict, with less economic and health disruption.

The average number of secondary transmissions from an infected person, or reproduction numbers (R0 and R), and the points at which the collective immunity begins to reduce the transmission of the infection, or herd immunity thresholds, are important epidemiological tools used in strategies of Covid-19 control, suppression, and mitigation. […] However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through asymptomatic carriers and, possibly, aerosols, has been ignored, and this may affect the effectiveness of Covid-19 control strategies. […] Therefore, consideration of the two possible ways of transmission would substantially increase the values of reproduction numbers, but if estimates of the contingent of the population naturally resistant to the virus, plus those with pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 were considered, the evaluation of herd immunity thresholds should reach their real and achievable levels.

[…] Our results show that there is a negative relationship between temperature and COVID-19 transmission rate. […] We also observe that temperature is positively associated with human mobility and human mobility is positively related to COVID-19 transmission rate. […] Therefore, although temperature is negatively related to COVID-19 transmission rate, governments and the public should pay more attention to control measures since people are more likely to go out when temperature rising.

Covid-19 exhibits high viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract at an early stage of infection, and has a high proportion of transmission competent individuals that are pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic, characteristics seen in H1N1pdm09 but not in SARS or MERS. […] These two traits of Covid-19 and H1N1pdm09 result in reduced efficiency in identification of transmission sources by symptomatic screening and play important roles in their ability to spread unchecked to cause pandemics. […] To overcome these attributes of Covid-19 in community transmission, identifying the transmission source by testing for virus shedding and interrupting chains of transmission by social distancing and public masking are required.

Biological data are lacking with respect to risk of vertical transmission and mechanisms of fetoplacental protection in maternal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. […] In viral load analyses among 107 women, there was no detectable viremia in maternal or cord blood and no evidence of vertical transmission. […] In this cohort study, there was no evidence of placental infection or definitive vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. […] Lack of viremia and reduced coexpression and colocalization of placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 may serve as protective mechanisms against vertical transmission.

This review was based on an electronic search of the literature in the Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed database published from December 2019 to July 2020 using combinations of the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 transmission, coronavirus transmission, waterborne, wastewater, airborne, fomites, and fecal-oral transmission. […] Samples taken from the wastewater collection network were detected contaminated with the novel coronavirus; consequently, there is a concern of its transmission via an urban sewer system. […] The still growing body of literature on COVID-19 and air, suggests the importance of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via air and indoor air quality, especially during lockdown interventions.

[…] Historical events and confirmed worldwide cases are compared with cumulative views of videos mentioning disease transmission over time. […] Across the three successive samples, views for all videos increased from ~ 125 million to over 560 million views, and from ~ 63 million to more than 273 million for those videos specifically mentioning disease transmission, respectively. […] This increase coincided with the increase in the worldwide number of cases and the occurrence of COVID-19 transmission informational milestones. […] Despite its importance for community mitigation, the majority of the widely viewed videos we sampled did not specifically mention disease transmission.

Because infection may be spread by people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. […] In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility data for estimating the geographical distribution of transmission risk. […] We present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments from near-real-time population mobility data. […] Two of these were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission scenario. […] Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of geographical patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in outbreaks involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual travel patterns. […] For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate that mobility data add the most value to risk predictions when case counts are low and spatially clustered.

Optimal control of COVID-19 depends on directing resources and health messaging to mitigation efforts that are most likely to prevent transmission, but the relative importance of such measures has been disputed.

[…] Level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from presymptomatic, never symptomatic, and symptomatic individuals. […] Combined, these baseline assumptions imply that persons with infection who never develop symptoms may account for approximately 24% of all transmission. […] In this base case, 59% of all transmission came from asymptomatic transmission, comprising 35% from presymptomatic individuals and 24% from individuals who never develop symptoms. […] In this decision analytical model of multiple scenarios of proportions of asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 and infectious periods, transmission from asymptomatic individuals was estimated to account for more than half of all transmissions. […] In addition to identification and isolation of persons with symptomatic COVID-19, effective control of spread will require reducing the risk of transmission from people with infection who do not have symptoms.

It is of critical importance to estimate changing transmission rates and their dependence on population mobility. […] A common approach to this problem involves fitting daily transmission rates using a Susceptive Exposed Infected Recovered (SEIR) model (regularizing them to avoid overfitting), and then computing the relationship between the estimated transmission rate and mobility. […] Unfortunately, there are often several, very different transmission rate trajectories that can fit the reported cases well, meaning that the choice of regularization determines the final solution (and thus the mobility-transmission rate relationship) selected by the SEIR model. […] Moreover, the classical approaches to regularization-penalizing the derivative of the transmission rate trajectory-do not correspond to realistic properties of pandemic spread. […] Consequently, models fit using derivative-based regularization are often biased toward underestimating the current transmission rate and future deaths. […] In this work, we propose mobility-driven regularization of the SEIR transmission rate trajectory. […] This method rectifies the artificial regularization problem, produces more accurate and unbiased forecasts of future deaths, and estimates a highly interpretable relationship between mobility and the transmission rate.

[…] We present a data-driven method to quantify the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), could lead to the change of malaria transmission potential in 2020. […] Finally, by treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020, we evaluate the negative effects of COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential based on the notion of vectorial capacity. […] By treating the total number of ITNs available in each country in 2020 as a baseline, our results show that even with stringent NPIs, malaria transmission potential will remain higher than expected in the second half of 2020. […] By quantifying the impact of various NPI response to the COVID-19 pandemic on malaria transmission potential, this study provides a way to jointly address the syndemic between COVID-19 and malaria in malaria-endemic countries in Africa. […] The results suggest that the early intervention of COVID-19 can effectively reduce the scale of the epidemic and mitigate its impact on malaria transmission potential.

[…] Droplet transmission was commonly reported to occur in particles with diameter &gt;5 µm that can quickly settle gravitationally on surfaces (1-2 m). […] Instead, fine and ultrafine particles (airborne transmission) can stay suspended for an extended period of time (≥2 h) and be transported further, e.g., up to 8 m through simple diffusion and convection mechanisms.

[…] In this narrative review, we develop an analytical framework to examine mask usage, synthesizing the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: population impact, transmission characteristics, source control, wearer protection, sociological considerations, and implementation considerations. […] A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals. […] Reducing disease spread requires two things: limiting contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and other measures and reducing the transmission probability per contact. […] The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected respiratory particles in both laboratory and clinical contexts.

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the preocular tear film raises speculation that the ocular surface can act as an initial site of infection as well as a potential source of person-to-person viral transmission. […] Together, these results highlight the importance of safety measures in ophthalmology practices to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2. […] Ophthalmology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic has been dramatically curtailed in an effort to reduce the risk of transmission and converse valuable personal protective equipment (PPE), and the impacts of the ongoing pandemic on ophthalmology practices will be felt for the foreseeable future.

m, the relatively high deposition fraction in the oral/laryngeal combined region warns of its easy transmission through casual talking/coughing. […] Moreover, considering droplet sizes’ effect on virus loading capacity, we built a correlation model to quantify the potential of virus expelling hazards, which suggests an amplified cascade effect on virus transmission on top of the existing transmission mechanism. […] It therefore highlights the importance of considering the instant expelling possibilities from inhaled droplets, and also implies potentials in restricting a rapid secondary transmission by measures that can lower down droplet deposition in the upper airways.

We observed that the overall incidence of ILI cases during 2019-2020 influenza season was considerably higher than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2, which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory patients. […] Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than previously thought. […] In conclusion, assessment of the community transmission among patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost importance to guide policy makers to optimize public health interventions. […] The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ILI cases shows the importance of ILI surveillance systems and warrants its further strengthening to mitigate the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

In most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. […] We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. […] We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. […] Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). […] Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. […] Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

[…] How droplets and aerosol particles disperse are being transported into the human breathing zone-the last few inches for airborne transmission to effectuate-remains a key question which has been widely overlooked. […] Here, we assessed the potential influences of the thermal plume on the transmission of COVID-19 and other airborne pathogens by reviewing the most pertinent evidence and analyzing key variables in the formation of thermal plume in indoor environments, e.g., ambient temperature, human posture and type of clothing. […] Our reviewed evidence and data indicate that the human thermal plume should facilitate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in enclosed spaces by elevating small droplets and airborne particles into the breathing zone from lower regions and ascending respiratory droplets from the sources into the upper atmosphere. […] By drawing attention to aerosol transport dynamics in the human microenvironment, these insights may be useful for understanding COVID-19 transmission in enclosed spaces, especially those intended for public use.

A collateral effect of these lockdowns may be a change to transmission dynamics of a wide range of infectious diseases that are all highly dependent on rates of contact between humans. […] With timing, duration and intensity of lockdowns varying country-to-country, the wave of lockdowns in 2020 present a unique opportunity to observe how changes in human contact rates, disease control and surveillance affect dengue virus transmission in a global natural experiment. […] We explore the theoretical basis for the impact of lockdowns on dengue transmission and surveillance then summarise the current evidence base from country reports. […] We find considerable variation in the intensity of dengue epidemics reported so far in 2020 with some countries experiencing historic low levels of transmission while others are seeing record outbreaks. […] Despite many studies warning of the risks of lockdown for dengue transmission, few empirically quantify the impact and issues such as the specific timing of the lockdowns and multi-annual cycles of dengue are not accounted for. […] Studying the impact of lockdowns on dengue transmission is important both in how we deal with the immediate COVID-19 and dengue crisis, but also over the coming years in the post-pandemic recovery period.

We rated the certainty of evidence for days to outbreak, transmission, cases missed and detected, diagnostic accuracy (i.e. true positives, false positives, true negatives, false negatives) using the GRADE approach. […] The second modelling study provides very low-certainty evidence that screening of healthcare workers in emergency departments using laboratory tests may reduce transmission to patients and other healthcare workers (assuming a transmission constant of 1.2 new infections per 10,000 people, weekly screening reduced infections by 5.1% within 30 days). […] Given the poor sensitivity of existing approaches, our findings point to the need for greater emphasis on other ways that may prevent transmission such as face coverings, physical distancing, quarantine, and adequate personal protective equipment for frontline workers.

The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among students and teachers in New York City public schools, the largest school system in the US. […] Classroom measurements conducted from December 2017 to September 2018 were used to estimate risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a modified Wells-Riley equation under a steady-state conditions and varying exposure scenarios (infectious student versus teacher, susceptible student versus teacher, with and without masks). […] We then used multivariable linear regression with GEE to identify school and classroom factors that impact transmission risk. […] The mean probability of transmission was generally low but varied by scenario (range: 0.0015-0.81). […] Transmission rates were higher during the heating season (beta=0.108, p=0.010), in schools in higher income neighborhoods (&gt;80K versus 20K-40K beta=0.196, p&lt;0.001) and newer buildings (&lt;50 years beta=0.237, p=&lt;0.001; 50-99 years beta=0.230, p=0.013 versus 100+ years) and lower in schools with mechanical ventilation (beta=0.141, p=0.057). […] Surprisingly, schools located in older buildings and lower-income neighborhoods had lower transmission probabilities, likely due to the greater outdoor airflow associated with an older, non-renovated buildings that allow air to leak in (i.e. drafty buildings). […] Despite the generally low risk of school-based transmission found in this study, with SARS-CoV-2 prevalence rising in New York City this risk will increase and additional mitigation steps should be implemented in schools now.

During disease transmission, the infectious droplet particle size varies widely, and the transmission risk varies significantly at different time nodes; therefore, the fuzzy term “aerosol” is not conducive to analyzing disease exposure risk. […] Recommendations for epidemic prevention and control strategies are: 1) Large droplets are the main conflict in disease transmission; thus, even if they are blocked by a homemade mask initially, it significantly contains the epidemic. […] 2) The early phase of contact, such as close-contact and short-range transmission, has the highest infection risk; therefore, social distancing can effectively keep the susceptible population from inhaling active viruses.

[…] Creative solutions such as application of topical viricidal agents, make-shift mask filters, three-dimensional (3-D) printable adapters for headlights, aerosol containing separation boxes, and a variety of new draping techniques have been developed to limit the risk of COVID-19 transmission. […] Thus, there is an increased need for solutions that mitigate the risk of viral transmission during office procedures and surgeries, especially given that most COVID-19 positive patients present asymptomatically. […] These solutions have a potential to minimize the risk of viral transmission in the current clinical environment and to create safer outpatient and operating room conditions for patients and healthcare staff.

[…] We developed and analyzed two classes of susceptible-forwarding-immune information propagation models with delay in transmission to describe the cross-propagation process of relevant information. […] The results of the parameter analysis showed that using different attractiveness indexes as the key parameters can control the information transmission with different release intervals, so it is considered as a key link in the design of an information communication strategy.

[…] We estimate that as of October 2020, individuals aged 20-49 are the only age groups sustaining resurgent SARS-CoV-2 transmission with reproduction numbers well above one, and that at least 65 of 100 COVID-19 infections originate from individuals aged 20-49 in the US.

In this study, a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 is proposed and analyzed to predict the transmission dynamics of the disease in Ethiopia. […] Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number and found that reducing the rate of transmission is the most important factor in achieving disease control. […] In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. […] The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease.

The possible formation of population gene pools of zoonotic viruses with a respiratory route of transmission and a possibility of a pandemic at different stages of biosphere evolution is analyzed. […] Forming of Poxviruses (Entomopoxvirinae) gene pool could be the beginning of transformation from Plants to Arthropoda (Carbon - 375 million years ago) with further evolution connected with Rodentia (Pliocene - 75-70 million years ago) and further separation of genera (500-300 thousand years ago), and respiratory transmission (epidemics) between humans (10-2 thousand years BC). […] Orthomyxoviruses relicts (genus Isavirus) were possibly connected with Ichthya (Silurian - 500-410 million years ago), and then close interaction with Aves (the Cretaceous, 125-110 million years ago) with the division of genera and respiratory transmission (epidemics) between humans (10-2 thousand BC). […] Next pandemic of influenza A could be catastrophic in terms of the number of victims and economic damage.Coronaviruses formed a gene pool by interaction with Amphibia (subfamily Letovirinae) and then with Chiroptera in Tertiary (110-75 million years ago) with transformation to Artiodactyla (Eocene - 70-60 million years ago), and only 10-2 thousand years BC acquired the ability to a respiratory transmission and became Alphaviruses, a seasonal infection of humans.

In this review, we discuss the main consequences of climate change and link these to how they impact the appearance of new viral pathogens, how they may facilitate transmission between usual and novel hosts, and how they may also affect the host’s ability to manage the infection. […] We emphasize how changes in temperature and humidity and other events associated with climate change influence the reservoirs of viral infections, their transmission by insects and other intermediates, their survival outside the host as well the success of infection in plants and animals. […] We conclude that climate change has mainly detrimental consequences for the emergence, transmission, and outcome of viral infections and plead the case for halting and hopefully reversing this dangerous event.

Based on SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we reconstruct a partial transmission tree of the early pandemic and coinfer the geographic location of ancestral lineages as well as the number of migration events into and between European regions. […] We find that the predominant lineage spreading in Europe during this time has a most recent common ancestor in Italy and was probably seeded by a transmission event in either Hubei, China or Germany. […] Sustained local transmission is first evident in Italy and then shortly thereafter in the other European regions considered. […] Before the first border closures in Europe, we estimate that the rate of occurrence of new cases from within-country transmission was within the bounds of the estimated rate of new cases from migration.
