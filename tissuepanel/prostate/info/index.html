Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers Radiation Oncology departments treat, and efficient resource utilization is essential in the setting of a pandemic. […] Herein, we aim to establish recommendations and a framework by which to evaluate prostate radiotherapy management decisions. […] Radiation Oncologists from the United States and United Kingdom rapidly conducted a systematic review and agreed upon recommendations to safely manage prostate cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. […] Recommendations are provided by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, including clinical node positive, post-prostatectomy, oligometastatic, and low volume M1 disease. […] Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available. […] Ultrahypofractionation was preferred for localized, oligometastatic, and low volume M1, and moderate hypofractionation was preferred for post-prostatectomy and clinical node positive disease. […] Resources can be reduced for all identified stages of prostate cancer.

Intriguingly, TMPRSS2 is an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer where it supports tumor progression and is involved in a frequent genetic translocation with the ERG gene. […] Here we put forward the hypothesis that ADTs may protect patients affected by prostate cancer from SARS-CoV-2 infections. […] The parameters used for each COVID-19 positive patient were gender, hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit (ICU), death, tumor diagnosis, prostate cancer diagnosis, and androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). […] Comparing the total number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT had a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to patients who did not receive ADT (OR 4.05; 95% CI 1.55-10.59). […] A greater difference was found comparing prostate cancer patients receiving ADT to patients with any other type of cancer (OR 5.17; 95% CI 2.02-13.40). […] However, prostate cancer patients receiving ADT appear to be partially protected from SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men and raises particular interest during the pandemic as recent reports show that the TMPRSS2 (and other serine proteases), which facilitate the entry, replication and budding of the virion from a cell, can be inhibited using androgen deprivation therapy. […] Nevertheless, patients with metastatic prostate cancer commonly receive chemotherapy which may compromise their immune system.

TMPRSS2 is an androgen responsive gene and its fusion represents one of the most frequent alterations in prostate cancer. […] Androgen suppression by androgen deprivation therapy and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors form the foundation of prostate cancer treatment.

[…] Methods An online survey was created to capture the perspective of the impact the COVID-19 restrictions have on the management of prostate cancer by Urologists and Radiation Oncologists in the Detroit Metropolitan area. […] Urologists surveyed indicated that most of the low risk prostate cancer surgeries were cancelled and 56.2% had half or more of intermediate and high risk disease prostatectomies cancelled as well. […] Radiation Oncologists indicated that prostate cancer patients ready to start treatment were mostly delayed with temporary surveillance or hormone therapy depending on risk category (60% indicated they delayed low risk and favorable intermediate risk cases, 56% unfavorable intermediate risk cases, and 44% high risk cases). […] Conclusion In the setting of this pandemic, the management of prostate cancer has shifted to a much more conservative approach.

An interesting debate concerning the potential relationship between androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and SARS-CoV-2 infection has recently been opened in the case of prostate cancer (PC), and the aim of this multi-centre cohort study was to investigate the incidence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostrate cancer (mCRPC).

Although there are very few studies describing the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infections in patients with prostate cancer, these patients are likely to be more susceptible to COVID-19 than healthy people because of their immunosuppressed state. […] However, there is no evidence that prostate cancer is a risk factor for COVID-19. […] The study integrated existing research findings and a meta-analysis of the data to investigate the prevalence of prostate cancer in males infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the adverse clinical outcomes in male patients with or without COVID-19. […] The results of this research may provide a basis for judging if prostate cancer is a risk factor for males infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the findings can effectively help to prevent COVID-19 in patients with prostate cancer.

[…] Across all prostate cancer stages, telemedicine consultations and return visits were recommended when resources/staff available.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused delays in definitive treatment of patients with prostate cancer. […] We aimed to develop guidance on criteria for prioritization for surgery and reconfiguring management pathways for non-metastatic stage of prostate cancer who opt for surgical treatment. […] A second aim was to identify the infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to achieve low likelihood of COVID-19 hazard if radical prostatectomy was to be carried out during the outbreak and whilst the disease is endemic. […] We conducted a systematic review of the evidence on COVID-19 and reviewed international guidance on prostate cancer. […] These were presented to an international prostate cancer expert panel (n=34) through an online meeting. […] Consensus opinion was defined as ≥80% agreement, which were used to reconfigure the prostate cancer pathways. […] Evidence on the delayed management of patients with prostate cancer is scarce. […] There was 100% agreement that prostate cancer pathways should be reconfigured and develop measures to prevent nosocomial COVID-19 for patients treated surgically. […] Re-configuring management pathways for prostate cancer patients is recommended if significant delay (&gt;3-6 months) in surgical management is unavoidable. […] The IPC processes proposed provide a framework for providing radical prostatectomy within an environment with low COVID-19 risk during the outbreak or when the disease remains endemic. […] The broader concepts could be adapted to other indications beyond prostate cancer surgery.

Different factors can increase the risk of prostate cancer, including older age, a family history of the disease. […] Androgen receptor (AR) initiates a transcriptional cascade which plays a serious role in both normal and malignant prostate tissues. […] TMPRSS2 protein is highly expressed in prostate secretory epithelial cells, and its expression is dependent on androgen signals. […] One of the molecular signs of prostate cancer is TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. […] In TMPRSS2-ERG-positive prostate cancers different patterns of changed gene expression can be detected. […] The possible molecular relation between fusion positive prostate cancer patients and the increased risk of lethal respiratory viral infections especially SARS-CoV-2 can candidate TMPRSS2 as an attractive drug target. […] The studies show that some molecules such as nicotinamide, PARP1, ETS and IL-1R can be studied deeper in order to control SARS-CoV-2 infection especially in prostate cancer patients. […] This review attempts to investigate the possible relation between the gene expression pattern that is produced through TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive prostate cancer and the possible influence of these fluctuations on the pathogenesis and development of viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2.

[…] The most pronounced mortality association was for colon cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage III: TTI 61-120 d, 38.9% vs. 181-365 d, 47.8%), followed by stage I NSCLC (5 y predicted mortality: TTI 61-120 d, 47.4% vs 181-365 d, 47.6%), while survival for prostate cancer was least associated (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, high risk: TTI 61-120 d, 12.8% vs 181-365 d, 14.1%), followed by breast cancer (eg, 5 y predicted mortality, stage I: TTI 61-120 d, 11.0% vs. 181-365 d, 15.2%).
