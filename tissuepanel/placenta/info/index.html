<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical characteristics and placental pathology of 2019-nCoV infection in pregnancy, and to evaluate intrauterine vertical transmission potential of 2019-nCoV infection. <b>Methods:</b> The placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection which were received in the Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology collected by February 4th, 2020 and retrospectively studied. […] Their clinical material including placental tissue and lung CT, and laboratory results were collected, meanwhile, nucleic acid detection of 2019-nCoV of the placentas were performed by RT-PCR. <b>Results:</b> Three placentas delivered from pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, who were all in their third trimester with emergency caesarean section. […] There were various degrees of fibrin deposition inside and around the villi with local syncytial nodule increases in all three placentas. […] One case of placenta showed the concomitant morphology of chorionic hemangioma and another one with massive placental infarction. […] All samples from three placentas were negative for the nucleic acid of 2019-nCoV. <b>Conclusions:</b> The clinical characteristics of pregnant women with 2019-nCoV infection in late pregnancy are similar to those of non-pregnant patients, and no severe adverse pregnancy outcome is found in the 3 cases of our observation. […] Pathological study suggests that there are no morphological changes related to infection in the three placentas.

Our results revealed that ACE2 was highly expressed in maternal-fetal interface cells including stromal cells and perivascular cells of decidua, and cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in placenta. […] And thus, both the vertical transmission and the placenta dysfunction/abortion caused by SARS-CoV-2 need to be further carefully investigated in clinical practice.

One recent review reported that in a small number of cases, two PCR swabs of the placenta were sent in additional to neonatal and cord blood testing, and both placental PCR swabs were negative.<sup>1</sup> Other studies have demonstrated the finding of SARS-CoV2 IgM in neonates born to mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy,<sup>2,3</sup> findings that may indicate vertical transmission of the virus in utero. […] We report our experience with placental/membrane SARS-CoV2 RNA PCR swab results after delivery to a series of symptomatic mothers with confirmed COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. […] Charts were reviewed for documentation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing sent from either the placenta or membranes within 30 minutes following delivery. […] Placental swabs were obtained from the amniotic surface after clearing the surface of maternal blood (placental PCR). […] Of 32 COVID-19 positive pregnant patients who gave birth in this timeframe, placental or membrane swabs were sent from 11 patients (Table). […] Of 11 placental or membrane swabs sent following delivery, 3 swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2, all in women with moderate to severe COVID-19 illness at time of delivery. […] This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in placental or membrane samples. […] In summary, the presence of viral RNA by RT-PCR in placenta/membranes at the time of delivery suggests the need for further research into the possibility of vertical transmission.

However, without positive RT-PCR tests of amniotic fluid, placenta, or cord blood, there is a lack of virologic evidence for intrauterine vertical transmission.

To describe histopathologic findings in the placentas of women with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during pregnancy. […] Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. […] Sixteen placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were examined (15 with live birth in the third trimester, 1 delivered in the second trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). […] Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), particularly abnormal or injured maternal vessels, and intervillous thrombi. […] Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased.The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. […] Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of decidual arteriopathy and other features of MVM, a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. […] These changes may reflect a systemic inflammatory or hypercoagulable state influencing placental physiology.

Despite reports of neonatal COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 has not been consistently isolated in perinatal samples thus, definitive proof of transplacental infection is still lacking. […] To address these questions, we assessed investigative tools used to confirm maternal-fetal infection and known protective mechanisms of the placental barrier that prevent transplacental pathogen migration. […] Histological examination demonstrated sparse viral particles, vascular malperfusion and inflammation in the placenta from pregnant women with COVID-19. […] The paucity of placental co-expression of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2, two receptors involved in cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2, may explain its relative insensitivity to transplacental infection. […] Further spatial-temporal studies are needed to determine the true potential for transplacental migration.

In March 2020, the World health organization reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic.<sup>1</sup> Khan et al., 2020, in their systemic review about positive COVID-19 pregnant women, showed a rate of 29.1% preterm birth and 16.4% low birth weight among their babies.<sup>2</sup> This increases the interest that hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19 may be associated with hypoxic injury in the placenta and developing pre-eclamptic state.

We present a case of second trimester pregnancy with symptomatic Covid-19 complicated by severe preeclampsia and placental abruption. […] We analyzed placenta for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 through molecular and immunohistochemical assays and by and electron microscopy, and we measured the maternal antibody response in blood to this infection. […] SARS-CoV-2 localized predominantly to syncytiotrophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. […] Histological examination of the placenta revealed a dense macrophage infiltrate, but no evidence for vasculopathy typically associated with preeclampsia. […] This case demonstrates SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the placenta, highlighting the potential for severe morbidity among pregnant women with Covid-19.

[…] We report that co-transcription of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is negligible in the placenta, thus not a likely path of vertical transmission for SARS-CoV-2. […] By contrast, receptors for Zika virus and cytomegalovirus, which cause congenital infections, are highly expressed by placental cell types.

In this review, we summarize studies regarding the potential evidence for transplacental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), characterize the expression of its receptors and proteases, describe the placental pathology and analyze virus-host interactions at the maternal-fetal interface. […] We further discuss the potential molecular mechanisms, whereby the placenta serves as a defense front against pathogens by regulating the interferon type III signaling, microRNA-triggered autophagy and the nuclear factor-κB pathway. […] Based on these data, we conclude that vertical transmission may occur but rare, ascribed to the potent physical barrier, the fine-regulated placental immune defense and modulation strategies. […] Particularly, immunomodulatory mechanisms employed by the placenta may mitigate violent immune response, maybe soften cytokine storm tightly associated with severely ill COVID-19 patients, possibly minimizing cell and tissue damages, and potentially reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

[…] Using the Amsterdam Consensus criteria to categorise the histopathology results, evidence of both fetal vascular malperfusion (35.3% of cases; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 27.7-43.0%) and maternal vascular malperfusion (46% of cases; 95% CI 38.0-54.0%) were reported, along with evidence of inflammation in the placentas (villitis 8.7% cases, intervillositis 5.3% of cases, chorioamnionitis 6% of cases). […] The placental pathologies observed in SARS-CoV-2 were consistent with findings following maternal SARS-CoV-1 infection. […] Of those tested, a minority of neonates (2%) and placental samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (21%). […] Limited conclusions can be drawn about the effect of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on placental pathology as most lack control groups and the majority of reports followed third trimester infection. […] A better understanding of the association between maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection and placental pathology will inform maternity care during the coronavirus pandemic.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been a debate whether pregnant women are at a specific risk for COVID-19 and whether it might be vertically transmittable through the placenta. […] We present a series of five placentas of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive women who had been diagnosed with mild symptoms of COVID-19 or had been asymptomatic before birth. […] We provide a detailed histopathologic description of morphological changes accompanied by an analysis of presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placental tissue. […] All placentas were term deliveries (40th and 41st gestational weeks). […] This placenta showed prominent lymphohistiocytic villitis and intervillositis and signs of maternal and foetal malperfusion. […] Viral RNA was present in both placenta tissue and the umbilical cord and could be visualized by in situ hybridization in the decidua. […] SARS-CoV-2 tests were negative at the time of delivery of 3/5 women, and their placentas did not show increased inflammatory infiltrates. […] There was no transplacental transmission to the infants. […] In acute COVID-19, prominent lymphohistiocytic villitis may occur and might potentially be attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placenta.

During pregnancy, the placental barrier protects the fetus from pathogens and ensures healthy development. […] To predict if the placenta is permissive to SARS-CoV-2, we utilized publicly available single-cell RNA-seq data to identify if the placental cells express the necessary factors required for infection. […] SARS-CoV-2 binding receptor ACE2 and the S protein priming protease TMPRSS2 are co-expressed by a subset of syncytiotrophoblasts (STB) in the first trimester and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) in the second trimester human placenta. […] In addition, the non-canonical receptor BSG/CD147 and other proteases (CTSL, CTSB, and FURIN) are detected in most of the placental cells. […] Other coronavirus family receptors (ANPEP and DPP4) were also expressed in the first and second trimester placental cells. […] Additionally, the term placenta of multiple species including humans expressed ACE2, DPP4, and ANPEP along with the viral S protein proteases. […] The ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive (ACE2 + TMPRSS2 +) placental subsets expressed mRNA for proteins involved in viral budding and replication. […] We carried out a systematic review and identified that in 12% of pregnant women with COVID-19, the placenta was infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the virus was detected in STBs. […] To conclude, herein we have uncovered the cellular targets for SARS-CoV-2 entry and have shown that these cells can potentially drive viremia in the developing human placenta.

This communication summarizes the spectrum of pathology findings from pregnant women with COVID-19 based upon the infection status of their infants and addresses the potential interpretation of these results in terms of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the placenta and the pathophysiology of maternal-fetal infection. […] Placentas from pregnant women with COVID-19 and uninfected neonates show significant variability in the spectrum of pathology findings. […] In contrast, placentas from infected maternal-neonatal dyads are characterized by the finding of mononuclear cell inflammation of the intervillous space, termed chronic histiocytic intervillositis, together with syncytiotrophoblast necrosis. […] These placentas show prominent positivity of syncytiotrophoblast by SARS-CoV-2, fulfilling the published criteria for transplacental viral transmission as confirmed in fetal cells through identification of viral antigens by immunohistochemistry or viral nucleic acid using RNA in situ hybridization. […] The co-occurrence of chronic histiocytic intervillositis and trophoblast necrosis appears to be a risk factor for placental infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as for maternal-fetal viral transmission, and suggests a potential mechanism by which the coronavirus can breach the maternal-fetal interface.

[…] Placental samples were studied with anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization. […] Placental examination was normal in 12 of 75 infected and 3 of 75 uninfected subjects, respectively. […] In the remaining cases, placental pathology correlated with obstetric comorbidities without significant differences between SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative women. […] SARS-CoV-2 was identified in one placenta of an infected, but asymptomatic, parturient. […] SARS-CoV-2 is seldom identified in placentas of infected women.

[…] At 13 weeks of gestation, her throat swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 but viral RNA was detected in the placenta and the Spike (S) proteins (S1 and S2) were immunolocalized in cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placental villi. […] The SARS-CoV-2 crossed the placental barrier, as the viral RNA was detected in the amniotic fluid and the S proteins were detected in the fetal membrane.

[…] SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in half of placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-positive women. […] SARS-CoV-2 tissue load was low in all but one patient which exhibited severe placental damage leading to neonatal neurological manifestations. […] The placental transcriptional response induced by high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 showed an immunopathology phenotype similar to autopsy lung tissues from patients with severe COVID-19. […] This finding contrasted with the lack of inflammatory response in placental tissues from SARS-CoV-2-positive women with low viral tissue load and from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. […] Importantly, no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was found in any newborns, suggesting that the placenta may be an effective maternal-neonatal barrier against the virus even in the presence of severe infection. […] Our observations suggest that severe placental damage induced by the virus may be detrimental for the neonate independently of vertical transmission.

Recent reports suggest SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, may be transmittable from pregnant mother to placenta and fetus, albeit rarely. […] The efficacy of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 critically depends on the availability of its receptor, ACE2, in the placenta. […] In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that placental ACE2 expression is oxygenation-dependent by studying the expression of ACE2 and associated cell entry regulators in the monochorionic twin anemia-polycythemia (TAPS) placenta, a model of discordant placental oxygenation. […] We performed a retrospective comparative immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and Cathepsin B expression in anemic and polycythemic territories of TAPS placentas (N = 14). […] Placental hypoxia is associated with upregulation of ACE2 expression, concomitant with increased expression of its key cell entry proteases. […] ACE2-regulated placental functions, both infection- and non-infection related, may be highly oxygenation-dependent.

Understanding the dynamics of maternal antibody responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection during pregnancy and subsequent transplacental antibody transfer can inform neonatal management as well as maternal vaccination strategies. […] Antibody concentrations and transplacental transfer ratios were analyzed in combination with demographic and clinical data. […] Placental transfer ratios more than 1.0 were observed among women with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections as well as those with mild, moderate, and severe coronavirus disease 2019. […] In this cohort study, maternal IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were transferred across the placenta after asymptomatic as well as symptomatic infection during pregnancy.

This report presents a case of stillbirth with associated placental pathology during week 35 in an otherwise healthy pregnant woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Placental findings in this case showed patchy acute chorionitis and diffuse infarction/villous necrosis of the placental parenchyma resulting in extensive vascular malperfusion. […] Fetal autopsy was most significant for placental findings and no congenital malformations were discovered. […] The findings in this case are consistent with reports in the literature of pathological placental changes associated with COVID-19. […] This outcome was supported by the histopathological findings in the placenta.

The present study was done to find the histopathological alterations in the placenta of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnancies with either no symptoms or mild coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 related symptoms and its association with neonatal outcomes. […] After delivery the histopathological examination of the placenta of these women was done and the findings recorded on a predesigned proforma based on the Amsterdam consensus criteria for evidence of maternal and fetal vascular malperfusion changes. […] The following features of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM) were significantly higher in the placentae of COVID-19 positive pregnancies: retroplacental hematomas (RPH), accelerated villous maturation (AVM), distal villous hyperplasia (DVH), atherosis, fibrinoid necrosis, mural hypertrophy of membrane arterioles (MHMA), vessel ectasia and persistence of intramural endovascular trophoblast (PIEVT). […] Additionally, perivillous fibrin deposition was also significantly higher in the placentae of cases. […] Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women, with otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies, show evidence of placental injury at a microscopic level. […] This placental injury apparently does not lead to poor pregnancy outcomes.

ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which play a critical role in the entrance of SARS-COV-2 into the cell, are coexpressed in placental development stages, so the placenta also carries a risk for this virus. […] Many studies have shown that this virus causes some histopathological changes in the placenta. […] This article focuses on revealing the effects of the virus on the placenta in all aspects.
