<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the prevalence, characteristics, and preventive status of skin injuries caused by personal protective equipment (PPE) in medical staff. <b>Approach:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted online for understanding skin injuries among medical staff fighting COVID-19 in February 8-22, 2020. […] The questionnaire items included demographic data, grade of PPE and daily wearing time, skin injury types, anatomical sites, and preventive measures. […] Univariable analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to explore the risk factors associated with skin injuries. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4,308 respondents were collected from 161 hospitals and 4,306 respondents were valid. […] The overall prevalence of skin injuries was 42.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.30-44.30) with three types of device-related pressure injuries, moist-associated skin damage, and skin tear. […] Co-skin injuries and multiple location injuries were 27.4% and 76.8%, respectively. […] The logistic regression analysis indicated that sweating (95% CI for odds ratio [OR] 87.52-163.11), daily wearing time (95% CI for OR 1.61-3.21), male (95% CI for OR 1.11-2.13), and grade 3 PPE (95% CI for OR 1.08-2.01) were associated with skin injuries. […] Only 17.7% of respondents took prevention and 45.0% of skin injuries were treated. <b>Innovation:</b> This is the first cross-sectional survey to understand skin injuries in medical staff caused by PPE, which is expected to be a benchmark. <b>Conclusion:</b> The skin injuries among medical staff are serious, with insufficient prevention and treatment.

Clinically, many of these skin lesions are likely secondary to occlusion of small to medium blood vessels due to microthrombi formation or due to viral laden antigen-antibody immune complexes; and same explanation may hold true for possible hypoxemic injury simultaneously occurring in other vital organs like lungs, heart, brain and kidneys.

The aim of this manuscript is to investigate skin diseases associated with COVID-19 under three main headings: Skin problems related to personal protective equipment and personal hygiene measures, skin findings observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and finally skin findings due to COVID- 19 treatment agents. […] Pressure injury, contact dermatitis, itch, pressure urticaria, exacerbation of pre-existing skin diseases and new skin lesion occurence / new skin disease occurence may be due to personal protective equipment. […] Skin problems related to personal hygiene measures could cause itch, dryness and contact dermatitis. […] Skin findings could also be observed in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. […] The incidence of skin lesions because of COVID-19 was reported between 0.2% and 29%. […] Many skin lesions such as maculopapular, urticarial, vesicular, chilblain- like, thrombotic / ischemic etc. could be observed in COVID-19. […] Some authors state that the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection specific skin finding is absent. […] But, especially in asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic COVID-19 patients, skin lesions can lead to the diagnosis of COVID-19. […] In addition skin lesions could occur due to COVID-19 treatment agents. […] As a result, many skin lesions could appear because of COVID-19. […] Even if there were no COVID-19 diagnosis, skin findings should be evaluated carrefully in this pandemic period. […] Key worlds: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, dermatology, skin findings.

[…] In the COVID period, there was a decrease of 68.61% in skin cancer diagnoses, from 3619 to 1136 (P &lt; 0.01). […] Surprisingly, skin cancer waiting times were also reduced in the COVID period compared to the pre-COVID period (median of 8 and 12 days, respectively; P &lt; 0.001).

Reports of dermatological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 suggest a possible cutaneous tropism of SARS-CoV-2; however, the capacity of this virus to infect the skin is unknown. […] To determine the susceptibility of the skin to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the expression of viral entry factors ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in this organ. […] A comprehensive analysis of human tissue gene expression databases was carried out looking for the presence of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes in the skin. mRNA expression of these genes in skin-derived human cell lines was also assessed. […] The analyses showed high co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the gastrointestinal tract and kidney, but not in the skin. […] Only the human immortalized keratinocyte HaCaT cell line expressed detectable levels of ACE2, and no cell line originating in the skin expressed TMPRSS2. […] It is possible that cutaneous blood vessels endothelial damage, as well as the effect of circulating inflammatory mediators produced in response to the virus, are the cause of skin involvement.

[…] We also found that skin damage to the mucosa of the nares, tongue, lips, and urethra presented first as inflammation and then progressed to thick eschar. […] Despite maximum pressure relief with the use of a pressure-relieving turn and position system, bordered foam dressings, fluidized positioners, specialty beds, and leadership support for twice-a-week skin checks, our patients diagnosed with COVID-19 developed extensive skin damage across the fleshy portion of the buttocks and on the mucosa of the nares, tongue, lips, and urethra during minimal exposure to pressure.

In the next future, dermatologists, endocrinologist and physicians may cope with the impact of extent SARS-CoV-2 (COVID 19) infection over chronic inflammatory skin diseases and their treatment. […] We searched for relevant studies (trials, real-life studies and case reports, meta-analysis, pooled data analysis, reviews) on endocrine disorders and inflammatory skin diseases. […] It has been demonstrated how these conditions correlate with the worsening of such chronic inflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, and acne. […] Many evidences suggest an important role of adipose tissue in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Leptin, adiponectin, TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, PAI-1), involved in the pathogenesis and the exacerbations of these skin diseases. […] Scientific evidences already show the important immunomodulating role of vitamin D in inflammatory skin diseases. […] Our study pays attention on medium-long term effects of COVID-19 outbreak on inflammatory skin disorders, due to the lifestyle changes.

Healthcare workers around the world are experiencing skin injury due to the extended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. […] These injuries are the result of high shear stresses acting on the skin, caused by friction with the PPE. […] A literature review into skin friction and skin lubrication was conducted to identify products and substances that can reduce friction. […] The response of skin to friction is a complex interplay between the lubricating properties and durability of the film deposited on the surface and the response of skin to the lubricating substance, which include epidermal absorption, occlusion, and water retention. […] Moisturising the skin results in excessive friction, and the use of products that are aimed at ‘moisturising without leaving a non-greasy feel’ should be prevented.

The purpose of this study was to examine the deltoid skin biopsy in twenty-three patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most severely ill, for vascular complement deposition and correlate this with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA and protein localization and ACE2 expression. […] Deltoid skin microvascular complement screening has been applied to patients with various systemic complement-mediated microvascular syndromes, best exemplified by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. […] Microvascular complement deposition strongly colocalized in situ with the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins including spike glycoproteins in the endothelial cells as well as the viral receptor ACE2 in lesional and nonlesional skin; viral RNA was not evident. […] Although the samples from severely ill patients with COVID-19 were from grossly normal skin, light microscopically focal microvascular abnormalities were evident that included endothelial cell denudement, basement membrane zone reduplication, and small thrombi. […] It is concluded that complement activation is common in grossly normal skin, especially in the subcutaneous fat which may provide a link between severe disease and obesity, in people with severe COVID-19, and the strong colocalization with the ACE2 receptor and viral capsid proteins without viral RNA suggests that circulating viral proteins (ie, pseudovirions) may dock onto the endothelial of these microvessels and induce complement activation.

Chronic skin exposure to a wet work environment, as well as disinfectants are factors contributing to epidermal barrier damage. […] The aim of the paper was to analyze selected skin parameters and skin lesions in the hands of laboratory diagnosticians. […] After the interview, the skin pH and moisture content were examined. […] Measurements were performed on the dorsal side of the dominant hand using the Skin-ph-Meter<sup>®</sup> PH 905 and Corneometer<sup>®</sup> CM 825 devices. […] The obtained moisture level values were qualified as dry or very dry skin, and the skin pH was within the reference range. […] No correlation between the skin pH value and the features examined (professional experience, the number of hours spent in protective gloves during the day, the number of hand washing episodes during the day) was not indicated. […] The level of skin moisture content seems to positively correlate with the time of wearing gloves. […] The use of hand moisturizers after each hand washing episode correlated with the level of skin moisture content.

[…] On the basis of previous referral data and statistical forecasting, we share our predicted numbers against our actual number of urgent skin cancer referrals for the COVID-19 period and, based on this analysis, encourage all cancer services to prepare and allocate resources appropriately for the busy months to follow.

As WOC nurses, we were tasked with formulating procedures for protecting the facial skin integrity of healthcare workers (HCWs) using personal protective devices when caring for patients with suspected or active COVID-19, while avoiding contamination when the masks are donned or doffed. […] We evaluated 6 topical products (an alcohol-free liquid acrylate, thin film dressing, thin hydrocolloid dressing, hydrocolloid blister care cushion, thin foam transfer dressing, and thick foam dressing) applied to skin in contact with 3 N95 respirators; all are available on our facility’s formulary and all are in widespread clinical use. […] We also evaluated cutaneous responses (skin integrity, irritation, comfort) during this period. […] No skin irritation was noted with any of the tested products after a 10-hour wear time underneath the N95 respirator masks, but mild discomfort was experienced with 3 of the dressings (thin film dressing and both hydrocolloid dressings). […] Based on these experiences, we recommend application of an alcohol-free liquid acrylate film to prevent facial skin injury associated with friction from the extended use of an N95 respirator mask. […] For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend use of protective dressings to maintain skin integrity and protection from coronavirus infection as HCWs continue to provide care to all of patients under their care.

At the beginning of the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, health care staff at a level 1 trauma center in the state of New York experienced facial irritation and skin breakdown under their N95 respirators due to increased and prolonged use. […] Members of the Certified Wound and Ostomy Nurse, Nurse Practitioners staff were charged with developing recommendations within 48 hours to help prevent and manage facial skin issues using available products that would not compromise the seal of the respirators. […] With the assistance of a health care safety specialist from the Environmental Health and Safety Department of the hospital, an ambient particle counting device was used to measure the N95 fit factor following application of a liquid skin barrier, transparent film dressing, light silicone-based adhesive dressing, or an extra-thin hydrocolloid dressing on the bridge of the nose and the cheekbones underneath an N95 respirator of 2 hospital staff members who volunteered to test the dressings. […] The highest fit factors were seen with the liquid skin barrier in the 2 volunteers (200 and 198, respectively). […] Thin dressing use may help reduce skin complications among hospital staff during periods of extended N95 respirator wear time. […] Studies are needed to help health care facilities optimize N95 respirator use to protect staff from coronavirus disease-19 and respirator-related skin complications while supply shortages remain.

Body temperature can be measured using thermal infrared imaging, a safe, non-contact method that relies on the emissivity of the skin being known to provide accurate readings. […] Skin pigmentation affects the absorption of visible light and enables us to see variations in skin colour. […] Human skin has an accepted emissivity of 0.98 but the effect of different skin pigmentation on this value is not known. […] In this study, we investigated the influence of different skin pigmentation on thermal emissivity in 65 adult volunteers. […] A reference object of known emissivity (electrical tape) was applied to participant’s skin on the inner upper arm. […] The emissivity was altered manually until the skin temperature using thermal imaging software was equal to the initial tape temperature. […] This provided the calculated emissivity value of the skin. […] Participants were grouped according to skin pigmentation, quantified using the Fitzpatrick skin phototyping scale and reflectance spectrophotometry. […] Differences in emissivity values between skin pigmentation groups were assessed by one-way ANOVA. […] No significant differences in emissivity were observed between participants when grouped by skin pigmentation according to the Fitzpatrick scale (p = 0.859) or reflectance spectrophotometry (p = 0.346). […] These data suggest that skin pigmentation does not affect thermal emissivity measurement of skin temperature using thermal infrared imaging.

The influence of various environmental factors on skin properties is well known. […] However, there is a lack of research into the effect of quarantine masks on skin properties, even though the use of masks has significantly increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. […] Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of mask use on skin properties. […] We measured eight skin biophysical parameters: temperature, redness, pore volume, texture, elasticity, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), sebum content, and pH, and evaluated acne lesions before and after using quarantine masks. […] Skin temperature, redness, and TEWL increased significantly after a 6-hour mask use, while the sebum content increased marginally. […] Skin elasticity was reduced by the use of masks over 1 and 2 weeks, whereas the pore volume and the number of acne lesions increased after a 2-week mask use. […] The skin changes caused by mask use showed sex-based differences in the skin elasticity (after 6 hours), redness, and roughness (after 2 weeks). […] The use of quarantine masks causes a change in the skin temperature, redness, and TEWL in the short term and in skin elasticity, pores, and acne in the long term. […] This study revealed that prolonged mask use could have negative effects on the skin.

Evaluate the diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate their duration and timing in relation to other COVID-19 symptoms METHODS: We used data from 336,847 UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app to assess the diagnostic value of body rash or an acral rash in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents to investigate skin-specific symptoms and collect their photographs. […] Using data from the app, we show significant association between skin rashes and a positive swab test result (OR:1.67, 95% confidence interval:1.41-1.96). […] Strikingly, among the respondents of the independent online survey, we found that 17% of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases reported skin rashes as the first presentation, and 21% as the only COVID-19 clinical sign. […] Together with the British Association of Dermatologists, we have compiled a catalogue of images of the most common skin manifestations of COVID-19 from 400 individuals (<a href="https://covidskinsigns.com" class="uri">https://covidskinsigns.com</a>), which we make publicly available to assist clinicians in recognition of this early COVID-19 clinical feature.

The benefits of PPE far outweigh the risks, nonetheless, many clinicians are exhibiting skin injury caused by PPE worn incorrectly. […] These skin injuries, ranging from lesions to open wounds are concerning because they increase the susceptibility of viral infection and transmission to other individuals. […] The NPIAP positions, which were formed by conducting a systematic review of what was known at the time, include: (1) Prepare skin before and after wearing PPE with skin sealants, barrier creams and moisturizers; (2) Frequent PPE offloading to relieve pressure and shear applied to skin; (3) treat visible skin injuries immediately caused by PPE to minimize future infection; (4) non-porous dressings may provide additional skin protection, but lack evidence; (5) health systems should take care to educate clinicians about placement and personal hygiene related to handling PPE. […] These NPIAP positions provided early guidance to reduce the risk of skin injury caused by PPE based on available research regarding PPE injuries, a cautious application of evidence-based recommendations on prevention of device related pressure injuries in patients and the expert opinion of the NPIAP Board of Directors.

Understanding of underlying pathophysiology directly relates to the novel skin microenvironment and textile-skin friction created by mask-wearing, distinct from nontextile-related acne mechanica previously linked to wearing of headgear. […] Additional textile-skin interactions include factors such as breathability, stickiness sensations, moisture saturation, and hygiene maintenance. […] Increased skin temperatures can trigger sweat/heat-related dermatoses, and ear loops potentially trigger pressure-induced dermatoses. […] Important therapeutic considerations include increased skin irritation potential of conventional acne treatments under occlusion, exacerbation of chronic dermatoses, that is, perioral dermatitis, rosacea, and eczema, and susceptibility of these same patient groups to heightened discomfort with mask-wearing. […] Prolonged textile-skin contact time, directly proportional to the risk of maskne, can be an opportunity for the application of biofunctional textiles.
