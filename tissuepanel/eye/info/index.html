[…] In this Viewpoint, the eyes and the body of the crocodile represent the public health preparedness and health systems, respectively, in SSA.

The conjunctival mucosa is directly exposed to infectious droplets expelled by patients during close contact and fomites when the eye is touched by contaminated hands.<sup>2, 3</sup> More over, the mucosa of the conjunctiva and upper respiratory tract is connected by nasolacrimal duct, and share the same entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on host cell membranes.<sup>2, 3</sup> Hence, it is reasonable to postulate that the conjunctiva may be easily involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may even act as a route of transmission during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To evaluate the potential infection risk of 2019-nCoV on ocular surface, we compared ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression among different eye tissues. <b>Methods:</b> Experimental article. […] Results were analyzed using Student’s <i>t</i>-test. <b>Results:</b> The expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes were the highest in conjunctiva among all the six mice eye tissues explored. […] The expression level of human conjunctiva ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were significantly higher than that in the cornea (<i>P</i>=0.007), with 5.74-fold and 12.84-fold higher in the conjunctiva than in the corneal epithelium cells, which resembled the situation in mice. <b>Conclusion:</b> The observation of high-level ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression in conjunctiva among the 6 eye tissues examined suggests that conjunctiva serves as an infection target tissue of 2019-nCoV. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2020, 56:)</i>. <b>目的：</b> 分析眼部组织新型冠状病毒侵染和激活关键蛋白人血管紧张素转换酶2（ACE2）和跨膜丝氨酸蛋白酶2（TMPRSS2）的表达情况，探讨新型冠状病毒在眼部的侵染基础。

Non-hermetically sealed eye protection does not fully protect the eyes from airborne particles.

[…] This study aimed to build and test a filtered eye mask (FEM) to protect the eyes from airborne particles, while being usable without excessive fog build up. […] A hermetically-sealed standard eye mask (SEM) and an FEM were examined at 1-minute, 5-minute and 60-minute periods for performance metrics relating to fog. […] An FEM may play an important role in preventing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) exposure by protecting the eyes from airborne particles and preventing fog, rendering it usable.

Recently, the role of the eye in transmitting 2019-nCoV has been intensively discussed. […] The role of the eye in the transmission of 2019-nCoV is discussed in detail. […] Although the conjunctiva is directly exposed to extraocular pathogens, and the mucosa of the ocular surface and upper respiratory tract are connected by the nasolacrimal duct and share the same entry receptors for some respiratory viruses, the eye is rarely involved in human CoV infection, conjunctivitis is quite rare in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and the CoV RNA positive rate by RT-PCR test in tears and conjunctival secretions from patients with 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV infection is also extremely low. […] This suggests that the eye is neither a preferred organ of human CoV infection nor a preferred gateway of entry for human CoVs for infecting the respiratory tract.

Conjunctival signs and symptoms are observed in a subset of patients with COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in tears, raising concerns regarding the eye both as a portal of entry and carrier of the virus. […] We analyzed human post-mortem eyes as well as surgical specimens for the expression of ACE2 (the receptor for SARS-CoV-2) and TMPRSS2, a cell surface-associated protease that facilitates viral entry following binding of the viral spike protein to ACE2. […] Across all eye specimens, immunohistochemical analysis revealed expression of ACE2 in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea, with especially prominent staining in the superficial conjunctival and corneal epithelial surface. […] All eye and conjunctival specimens also expressed TMPRSS2.

Background: Ophthalmic clinicians report low confidence in telemedicine-based eye care delivery, but it may have changed given its rapid expansion during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. […] Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine clinician confidence in telemedicine-based eye care services during COVID-19. […] Materials and Methods: An electronic survey was sent to clinicians at University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center (April 17, 2020-May 6, 2020) when nonemergent in-person visits and procedures were restricted. […] The primary outcome was clinician confidence in using telemedicine-based eye care during COVID-19. […] Clinician confidence was associated with telemedicine visit volume and intention to continue using telemedicine.Conclusions: Policies that foster clinician confidence will be important to sustain telemedicine-based eye care delivery.

The aim of this study was to explore knowledge, practice of risk and guidelines of the novel corona virus disease (COVID-19) infection among the eye care practitioners and the potential associated factors. […] A cross-sectional self-administered online survey was distributed via emails and social media networks between 2nd and 18th May 2020 corresponding to the week of the lockdown in Nigeria to eye care practitioners (ECPs). […] ECPs in Nigeria displayed good knowledge about COVID-19 and provided eye care services during the COVID-19 lockdown in Nigeria, despite the majority not receiving any training on the use of PPEs with concerns over attending to patients.

Considering the widespread use of topical ophthalmic medications (e.g., eye drops) by the general population, for various reasons (e.g., artificial tears, anti-glaucoma medications, topical antibiotics, etc.), the existence of their side effects as antiviral action should be investigated in-depth because it could possibly explain the aforementioned controversial data and represent a potential antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 replication/diffusion on the ocular surface. […] Here, we discuss and elucidate the antiviral side effect of many eye drops and ophthalmic ointments commonly used for others purposes, thus showing that these secondary effects (not to be confused with the ‘adverse effects’) might be of primary importance in a number of viral infections (e.g., those for which there is no validated treatment protocol), according to a drug repurposing approach.

Some scholars also pointed out that the possibility of transmission through the digestive system and eyes should not be ignored. […] Whether infection with 2019-nCoV will develop eye symptoms and whether the virus will spread through eyes are confusing to the medical workers and the general public, and it is ophthalmologists’ responsibility to carry out in-depth discussions. […] Based on the ocular manifestations of viral diseases, this article analyzes whether the eye secretions and tears carry the virus, and whether ophthalmologists and patients are at a high risk for 2019-nCoV infection, and then presents the current research methods and the necessary prevention and control measures in the field of ophthalmology, with an aim to contribute to the fight against 2019-nCoV.

[…] The factors significantly correlated with OSDI scores were age and duration of wearing protective glasses, while the duration of wearing protective glasses may be a protective factor of dry eye symptoms.Our study showed that most of the doctors and nurses worked at the front-line of combating COVID-19 did not experience DES, while the symptoms of those who experienced DES might be improved by wearing protective glasses.

[…] Descriptive study of the challenges faced in eye banking during the lockdown, and practices adopted to overcome the critical aspects in the clinical care of patients who presented with emergency corneal diseases requiring keratoplasty. […] Complete lockdown orders from the Indian government, as a strategy to control the Coronavirus pandemic, resulted in drastic reduction of all types of elective corneal transplants and eye banking activities from March 24, 2020 to May 31, 2020. […] The sudden cessation of eye banking resulted in an acute demand and supply imbalance of fresh donor corneas for transplants during this time. […] Our network of eye banks addressed this issue by adopting glycerol preservation of donor corneas, which were subsequently utilized for tectonic penetrating keratoplasty. […] We performed 31 therapeutic keratoplasties during the nationwide lockdown among our network of tertiary eye care centers.

This extended duration of prone positioning puts patients at risk of developing orbital compartment syndrome if direct pressure to the orbit and the globe occurs and concomitant protection of the eyes is not undertaken. […] A bedside eye examination was performed on 4 selected patients due to the observed presence of substantial periorbital edema. […] Prolonged prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 can be associated with elevated intraocular pressure from periorbital edema, direct compression on the eye, and increased orbital venous pressure. […] Orbital compartment syndrome can be avoided by the use of protective cushioning around the eyes and maintaining the patient’s head position above heart level during prone positioning.

The aim of this study was to formulate a methodological approach for resuming eye bank services during COVID-19 pandemic. […] Eye bank operations were temporarily halted in March after the government-mandated “Lockdown” in response to COVID-19 pandemic. […] Before restarting eye bank operations in May, we studied sources of exposure, performed risk assessment, instituted additional process validations and redefined the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) in consultation with the guidelines published by the Eye bank Association of India and All India Ophthalmological Society. […] The eye bank staff were rigorously trained before and after operations were restarted. […] All eye bank staff were aware of COVID-19 pandemic and 86% said they felt safe working at the eye bank. 86% of the staff said that they received adequate training and 66% of the staff expressed that they always received proper PPE and kits. […] Overall, 93% of the staff expressed that the measures taken by the eye bank ensured their safety. […] Based on our experience we suggest the following activities for planned resumption of eye bank services during the pandemic: Exposure Risk Analysis, Personal Protective Equipment usage training, SOP Revision and staff training on modified SOPs.

To determine the effect of taping the top of face masks on air particle counts directed toward the eye during simulated intravitreal injections. […] The number of air particles were quantified using a particle counter suspended over the right eye while each subject breathed normally, deeply, or spoke using a standardized script. […] Taping the top of cloth masks prior to simulated intravitreal injections significantly reduced air particle counts directed toward the eye when subjects were speaking compared to no taping. […] This may have implications for decreasing air particles reaching the eye during intravitreal injections, including aerosolized droplets from a patient’s mouth that may carry oral pathogens.
