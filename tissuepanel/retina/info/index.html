[…] As analysis for three different sequences (RdRp-gene, E-gene and Orf1 gene) revealed positive results in RT-PCR, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in human retina is proven according to the standards of the World-Health-Organization.

To reduce disease transmission, national regulatory agencies temporarily recommended curtailment of all nonurgent office visits and elective surgeries in March 2020, including vitreoretinal outpatient care in the USA. […] The effect of these guidelines on utilization of vitreoretinal care has not been explored to date. […] Retinal outpatient visits, new patient visits, intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections and in-office multimodal retinal imaging has seen a significant decline in utilization in the early phase of the pandemic. […] Telemedicine visits, enabled by new national legislation for all areas of medicine, have been adopted to a modest degree by the retina community. […] In-office retinal care declined in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and national regulatory guidelines limiting nonurgent care.

[…] Seven single cases and one case series, reporting a total of 10 patients affected by retinal changes secondary to long-term ritonavir treatment, were included in the review. […] Variable degrees of outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium changes were detected in most of the patients, with two patients showing macular telangiectasia, four patients presenting intraretinal crystal deposits, two patients disclosing a bull’s eye maculopathy, and two patients revealing midperipheral bone spicule-like pigment changes. […] We aimed to alert ophthalmologists on the importance of recognizing ritonavir-induced retinal impairment in SARS-CoV-2 patients.

Recent studies demonstrated not only retinal impairments but also detected SARS-CoV-2 in the retina of patients with COVID-19. […] This letter discusses the retinal tropism of SARS-CoV-2, describing possible routes for this coronavirus to reach the retina and cellular mechanisms involved in the retinal cell infection. […] Determining how SARS-CoV-2 can affect the retinal tissue is essential for the development of new therapeutic strategies and preventive measures, as well as for understanding the possible relationship between COVID-19 damage to the retina and to the brain.

We screened the fundus of patients with COVID-19 to detect alterations of the retina and its vasculature and to assess possible correlations with clinical parameters. […] The presence of retinal alterations in patients with COVID-19 and subjects unexposed to the virus was assessed using fundus photographs and their prevalence was compared. […] The influence of clinical/lab parameters on retinal findings was tested in COVID-19 patients. 54 patients and 133 unexposed subjects were enrolled. […] Retinal findings in COVID-19 included: haemorrhages (9·25%), cotton wools spots (7·4%), dilated veins (27·7%), tortuous vessels (12·9%). […] COVID-19 can affect the retina.

[…] Retinographies were analysed by two retina specialists. […] The main findings were flame-shaped haemorrhages (N=4; 22.2%; 95% CI 9.0 to 45.2) and ischaemic pattern lesions (cotton wool spots and retinal sectorial pallor) (N=4; 22.2%; 95% CI 9.0 to 45.2), with one patient having both cotton wool spots and flame-shaped haemorrhages.

However, evidence supporting that the retina is a target tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still lacking. […] This present study aimed to investigate whether ACE2 expression plays a role in human retinal neurons during SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived retinal organoids and monolayer cultures derived from dissociated retinal organoids were generated. […] To validate the potential entry of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the retina, we showed that hiPSC-derived retinal organoids and monolayer cultures endogenously express ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) on the mRNA level. […] Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the protein expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in retinal organoids and monolayer cultures. […] Furthermore, using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus spike protein with GFP expression system, we found that retinal organoids and monolayer cultures can potentially be infected by the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. […] Collectively, our findings highlighted the potential of iPSC-derived retinal organoids as the models for ACE2 receptor-based SARS-CoV-2 infection.
