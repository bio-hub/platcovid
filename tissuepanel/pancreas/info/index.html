Adipose tissue is one of the most important MSCs sources in the body, and adipose derived stromal cells (ADSCs) from adipose tissue are also one of the most valuable components of stromal vascular fraction (SVF). […] Adipose tissue-derived stromal cells have three main features: Immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and regenerative. […] While suggesting any adipose tissue-derived treatment method possibility, the relation of adipose tissue COVID-19 should not be ignored. […] Because, COVID-19 shows its effect through ACE-2 and adipose tissue is very rich and important tissue in terms of ACE-2.

Articles have alluded that the level of ACE2 gene expression in adipose tissue is higher than lung tissue, but a PubMed search found no results in articles to demonstrate this. […] The aim of this study was to investigate ACE2 gene expression in adipose tissue and lung tissue using a public database. […] ACE2 gene expression was present in both visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. […] The gene expression profile demonstrated that ACE2 gene expression was higher in human visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues than human lung tissue. […] This study demonstrates that ACE2 gene expression is higher in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue than that in lung tissue, a major target tissue affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We hypothesize here that increased ACE2 expression in adipose tissue displayed by people with obesity may increase SARS-CoV-2 infection and accessibility to this tissue. […] Individuals with obesity have increased white adipose tissue, which may act as a reservoir for a more extensive viral spread with increased shedding, immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine amplification. […] Here we discuss how obesity is related to a pro-inflammatory and metabolic dysregulation, increased SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry in adipose tissue and induction of hypercoagulopathy, leading people with obesity to develop severe forms of COVID-19 and also death. […] Taken together, it may be crucial to better explore the role of visceral adipose tissue in the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and investigate the potential therapeutic effect of using specific target anti-inflammatories (canakinumab or anakinra for IL-1β inhibition; anti-IL-6 antibodies for IL-6 inhibition), anticoagulant or anti-diabetic drugs in COVID-19 treatment of people with obesity.
