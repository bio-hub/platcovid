This paper reviews various investigative modalities for colorectal disease which could be deployed during cessation of colonoscopy services. […] We focus on colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) due to its relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ability to triage patients effectively to further endoscopic investigations. […] CT of the abdomen and pelvis has been suggested as a triage tool while access to colonoscopy is limited. […] Faecal immunochemistry tests have been demonstrated as a good predictor of colonic pathology and could be safely used to risk stratify patients when prioritising colonoscopy. […] CCE is a safe and innovative technology for investigating the colon. […] It has been shown to be an accurate detector of colonic neoplasia and can reduce demand for colonoscopy. […] As colonoscopy services resume, they will likely experience high demand leading to further delays for patients. […] CCE could be used to reduce the number of patients requiring colonoscopy and triage those requiring further endoscopic investigations appropriately.

[…] However, no viral particles were observed within the enterocytes to suggest direct viral injury as the cause of colonic perforation. […] These data and absence of known risk factors for spontaneous colonic perforation implicate IL-6Ra therapy as the potential mediator of colonic injury in this case.

The positive results obtained with intracorporeal resection and anastomosis in the right colon and rectum prompts us to adapt these procedures to the left colon. […] Preliminary results of 17 patients with left-sided colonic pathologies, 15 neoplasia and two diverticular disease who underwent 4 left hemicolectomies, 6 sigmoidectomies and 7 high anterior resections.

Using primary epithelial organoids from human colon, we explored how the central antiviral mediator IFN-γ, which is elevated in COVID-19, affects epithelial cell differentiation, ACE2 expression, and susceptibility to infection with SARS-CoV-2. […] In mouse and human colon, ACE2 is mainly expressed by surface enterocytes.

In this modelling study, we used four country-specific colorectal cancer microsimulation models-Policy1-Bowel (Australia), OncoSim (Canada), and ASCCA and MISCAN-Colon (the Netherlands)-to estimate the potential impact of COVID-19-related disruptions to screening on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in Australia, Canada, and the Netherlands annually for the period 2020-24 and cumulatively for the period 2020-50.
