However, experimental work examining the direct actions of chloroquine on mechanoreceptive hair cells in common experimental models is lacking. […] This study examines the effects of chloroquine on hair cells using two common experimental models: the zebrafish lateral line and neonatal mouse cochlear cultures. […] Zebrafish larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine for 1 h or 24 h, and hair cells assessed by antibody staining. […] A significant, dose-dependent reduction in the number of surviving hair cells was seen across conditions for both exposure periods. […] In mouse cochlear cultures, chloroquine damage was specific to outer hair cells in tissue from the cochlear basal turn, consistent with susceptibility to other ototoxic agents.

There are multiple etiologies for hair thinning and loss, including genetic, hormonal, immune, scaring, and infectious. […] Hair loss treatment involves both surgical intervention and nonsurgical therapies such as pharmaceuticals, haircare products, vitamins, and low-level laser therapy (LLLT). […] With so many available treatments, consumers often research their options using search engines such as Google and/or seek help from hair restoration physicians. […] To identify and analyze changing trends in international consumer and physician interest in nonsurgical hair loss therapies. […] Worldwide trends in Google searches of hair loss products (2004-2020) were compared with product prescription frequency surveys from members of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (2004-2019, ~29% response rate). […] Minoxidil and finasteride were the most prescribed hair loss treatments, while “minoxidil” was the most “Googled” term. […] Nutritionals and haircare prescriptions increased over time. […] The COVID-19 pandemic initially negatively affected hair loss treatment searches, which have since returned to, and surpassed, pre-pandemic levels. […] Regulations and social media have influence on consumer interest in hair loss products. […] A weak economy and coronavirus fears may persuade consumers to turn to cheaper hair loss treatment alternatives. […] Hair restoration specialists need to keep abreast of online trends to communicate effectively with their patients. […] Patients should be cognizant of the safety and efficacy of hair restoration treatments.

Hair loss affects most people at some point in their lifetime, causing anxiety and decreased self-esteem. […] Many surgeons who provide these treatments belong to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgeons (ISHRS). […] To investigate trends in surgical hair restoration treatment from both the surgeon and patient perspectives. […] Patient epidemiological and surgical data from the ISHRS were combined with search trend data from Google to analyze changing trends in surgical hair restoration treatment. […] Worldwide Internet searches for “hair transplant” have increased from 2004 to the present. […] Follicular unit excision (FUE) has supplanted follicular unit transplant (FUT) as the most popular hair transplant performed. […] Hair restoration clinics and Google searches were affected adversely by the COVID-19 pandemic. […] Technological advances in available therapies, improvement in delivery systems, changes in hair fashion, and global events have direct impact on hair restoration treatments offered by physicians and researched by patients. […] It is in the best interest of all hair restoration providers to keep abreast of changing technologies and treatment trends to stay at the forefront of their profession.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic increasing the use of hand disinfectants, we investigated the effect of frequent use of ethanol-based hand disinfectants (EBHD) on the levels of the alcohol marker ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair. […] Hair samples were collected from 10 health professionals (8 nondrinkers, 2 rarely drinking individuals) and EtG was examined in hair. […] EtG (~2 pg/mg) was only detected in the hair sample of a nondrinker using EBHD 60-70 times per working day. […] Our data provide no evidence that frequent EBHD use results in hair EtG levels above the recommended Society of Hair Testing cutoff for repeated alcohol consumption (5 pg/mg).
