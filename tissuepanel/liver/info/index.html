Routine blood test revealed WBC &lt;4.0×10(9)/L in 8 petients (26.67%) , (4-10) ×10(9)/L in 22 petients (73.33%) , and WBC&gt;4.0×10(9)/L in 4 petients (13.33%) during the disease.Lymphocyte count &lt;1.0×10(9)/L occurred in 12 petients (40%),abnormal liver function in 7 petients (23.33%) ,myocardial damage in 5 petients(16.67%), elevated D-dimer (&gt;0.5mg/l) in 5 patients (16.67%). […] Compared with normal patients, the average exposure times, cumulative exposure time, BMI, Fever time, white blood cell count, liver enzyme, LDH, myoenzyme and D-dimer were significantly increased in severe patients, while the lymphocyte count and albumin levels in peripheral blood were significantly decreased.Chest CT mainly showed patchy shadows and interstitial changes.According to imaging examination, 11 patients (36.67%) showed Unilateral pneumonia and 19 patients (63.33%) showed bilateral pneumonia,4 patients (13.33%) showed bilateral multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity.Compared with the patients infected in the protected period, the proportion of severe infection and bilateral pneumonia were both increased in the patients infected in unprotected period. <b>Conclusion:</b> Medical staffs are at higher risk of infection.Infection rates are associated with contact time, the amount of suction virus. […] Severe patients had BMI increased, heating time prolonged , white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, D-dimer and albumin level significantly changed and were prone to be complicated with liver damage and myocardial damage.Strict protection measures is important to prevent infection for medical workers. <b>目的：</b> 探讨医务人员新型冠状病毒肺炎（简称新冠肺炎）的临床特征。

<b>Objective:</b> To explore and analyze the possible mechanism of liver injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (novel coronavirus pneumonia, NCP). <b>Methods:</b> The correlation between ALT, AST and other liver enzyme changes condition and NCP patients’ disease status reported in the literature was comprehensively analyzed. […] ACE2 expression in liver tissue for novel coronavirus was analyzed based on single cell sequencing (GSE115469) data. […] RNA-Seq method was used to analyze Ace2 expression and transcription factors related to its expression in liver tissues at various time-points after hepatectomy in mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy. <i>t</i>-test or Spearman rank correlation analysis was used for statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> ALT and AST were abnormally elevated in some patients with novel coronavirus infection, and the rate and extent of ALT and AST elevation in severe NCP patients were higher than those in non-severe patients. […] Liver tissue results of single cell sequencing and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 was only expressed in bile duct epithelial cells of normal liver tissues, and very low in hepatocytes. […] In a mouse model of acute liver injury with partial hepatectomy, Ace2 expression was down-regulated on the first day, but it was elevated up to twice of the normal level on the third day, and returned to normal level on seventh day when the liver recovered and hepatocyte proliferation stopped. […] Whether this phenomenon suggests that the bile duct epithelial cells with positive expression of Ace2 participate in the process of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy deserves further study. […] In RNA-Seq data, 77 transcription factors were positively correlated with the expression of ACE2 (r &gt; 0.2, FDR &lt; 0.05), which were mainly enriched in the development, differentiation, morphogenesis and cell proliferation of glandular epithelial cells. <b>Conclusion:</b> We assumed that in addition to the over activated inflammatory response in patients with NCP, the up-regulation of ACE2 expression in liver tissue caused by compensatory proliferation of hepatocytes derived from bile duct epithelial cells may also be the possible mechanism of liver tissue injury caused by 2019 novel coronavirus infection. <b>目的：</b> 探索和分析新型冠状病毒感染肺炎（NCP）患者发生肝损伤的可能机制。

<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical characteristics of cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia and a preliminary study to explore the relationship between different clinical classification and liver damage. <b>Methods:</b> Consecutively confirmed novel coronavirus infection cases admitted to seven designated hospitals during January 23, 2020 to February 8, 2020 were included. […] ALT, AST, ALB and TBil of the severe or critical subgroups were 60.25 (40.88 ~ 68.90) U/L, 37.00 (20.88 ~ 64.45) U/L, 35.75 (28.68 ~ 42.00) g/L, and 20.50 (11.28 ~ 25.00) mmol/L, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The results of this multicenter retrospective study suggests that novel coronavirus pneumonia combined with liver damage is more likely to be caused by adverse drug reactions and systemic inflammation in severe patients receiving medical treatment. […] Therefore, liver function monitoring and evaluation should be strengthened during the treatment of such patients. <b>目的：</b> 分析新型冠状病毒肺炎病例的临床特征，初步探讨不同临床分型与肝功能损伤的关系。

We also isolated alive viral strains from feces, indicating potential infectiousness of feces.Dynamic cytokine detection was necessary to timely identifyingcytokine storms and application of artificial liver blood purification system. […] The artificial liver blood purification system could rapidly remove inflammatory mediators and block cytokine storm.Moreover, it also favoredthe balance of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base and thus improved treatment efficacy in critical illness.

<b>Objective:</b> To understand the clinical characteristics, change of liver function, influencing factors and prognosis in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) combined with liver injury. <b>Methods:</b> The general conditions, biochemical indicators of liver, blood clotting mechanism, routine blood test, UGT1A1 * 28 gene polymorphism and other data of 40 cases with COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Tangdu Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. […] The clinical characteristics, influencing factors and prognosis of liver injury in patients with liver injury group and those with normal liver function group were compared. […] Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the main influencing factors of liver injury. <b>Results:</b> Of the 40 cases, 25 were male (62.5%) and 15 were female (37.5%), aged 22 to 83 (53.87 ± 15.84) years. […] Liver injury was occurred in 22 cases (55%) during the course of the disease. […] Liver function injury was more likely to occur in patients who used many types of drugs and large amounts of hormones (<i>P</i> = 0.002, <i>P</i> = 0.031), and there was no correlation with the TA6TA7 mutation in the UGT1A1 * 28 gene locus. […] Multiple regression analysis showed that the occurrence of liver injury was only related to critical illness. […] The liver function of all patients had recovered within one week after conventional liver protection treatment. <b>Conclusion:</b> COVID-19 combined with liver function injury may be due to the slight elevation of transaminase, mostly around the second week of the disease course. […] Severe patients have a higher proportion of liver injury, and critical type is an independent risk factor for liver injury. <b>目的：</b> 了解新型冠状病毒肺炎（COVID-19）住院患者合并肝损伤的临床特点、肝功能变化、影响因素及预后。

Among these 9 pregnant women with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection, onset of clinical symptoms occurred before delivery in 4 cases, on the day of delivery in 2 cases, and after delivery in 3 cases. […] Clinically, the first symptom in the neonates was shortness of breath (n=6), but other initial symptoms such as fever (n=2), thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function (n=2), rapid heart rate (n=1), vomiting (n=1), and pneumothorax (n=1) were observed. […] Perinatal 2019-nCoV infection may have adverse effects on newborns, causing problems such as fetal distress, premature labor, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia accompanied by abnormal liver function, and even death.

[…] The presence of abnormal liver tests became more pronounced during hospitalization within 2 weeks, with 49 (23.4%), 31 (14.8%), 24 (11.5%) and 51 (24.4%) patients having alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels elevated to more than 3× the upper limit of normal, respectively. […] Patients with abnormal liver tests of hepatocellular type or mixed type at admission had higher odds of progressing to severe disease (odds ratios [ORs] 2.73; 95% CI 1.19-6.3, and 4.44, 95% CI 1.93-10.23, respectively). […] The use of lopinavir/ritonavir was also found to lead to increased odds of liver injury (OR from 4.44 to 5.03, both p &lt;0.01). […] Patients with abnormal liver tests were at higher risk of progressing to severe disease. […] The detrimental effects on liver injury mainly related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which should be monitored and evaluated frequently. […] Data on liver tests in patients with COVID-19 are scarce. […] We observed a high prevalence of liver test abnormalities and liver injury in 417 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our referral center, and the prevalence increased substantially during hospitalization. […] The presence of abnormal liver tests and liver injury were associated with the progression to severe pneumonia. […] The detrimental effects on liver injury were related to certain medications used during hospitalization, which warrants frequent monitoring and evaluation for these patients.

[…] The overall prevalence of chronic liver disease at baseline was 3% (95% CI 2%-4%; I<sup>2</sup> = 29.1%). […] Individuals with severe COVID-19 disease had relevant alterations of liver enzymes and coagulative profile, probably due to the innate immune response against the virus.

We reported the distributional and temporal patterns of liver injury indicators in these patients and determined their associated factors and death risk. […] Longitudinal liver function tests were retrospectively analyzed and correlated with the risk factors and death. […] Liver injury dynamic patterns differed in alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin (TBIL). […] AST abnormality was associated with the highest mortality risk compared to other indicators of liver injury during hospitalization. […] Common factors associated with elevated liver injury indicators were lymphocyte count decrease, neutrophil count increase, and male gender. […] CONCLUSION: The dynamic patterns of liver injury indicators and their potential risk factors may provide an important explanation for the COVID-19-associated liver injury. […] Because elevated liver injury indicators, particularly AST, are strongly associated with the mortality risk, our study indicates that these parameters should be monitored during hospitalization.

Liver impairment has been frequently reported as a common manifestation, although its clinical significance is still unclear, particularly in patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD). […] To summarize the changes in liver function tests during SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of COVID-19 in patients with underlying CLD. […] A literature review using online database Pubmed was done using the search terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “liver”, “cirrhosis” and “liver transplantation”. […] COVID-19 is frequently associated with different degrees of abnormal liver function tests, most notably transaminases, which are usually transitory and of mild degree. […] Available evidence suggests that liver injury may result from direct pathogenic effect by the virus, systemic inflammation or toxicity from commonly used drugs in this subset of patients. […] SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is associated with minimal or no increase in liver enzymes, thus the presence of abnormal liver function tests should trigger evaluation for underlying liver diseases. […] Although it seems that patients with CLD are not at greater risk for acquiring the infection, those with cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, autoimmune liver diseases or liver transplant may have a greater risk for severe COVID-19. […] Abnormal liver function tests during the course of COVID-19 are common, though clinically significant liver injury is rare.

COVID-19 is highly contagious and has a variety of clinical manifestations, it can affect a number of other organs in addition to the lungs, and liver injury may occur. […] SARS-CoV-2 can cause liver injury through systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), cytokine storms, ischemia-reperfusion injury, side effects of treatment drugs, and underlying liver disease and can attack liver cells directly via ACE2. […] Clinical studies have found that liver injury in COVID-19 patients mainly manifests as abnormal liver biochemical indicators, but there have been no reports of liver failure caused by this disease. […] The number of COVID-19 patients with liver injury is increasing, and the incidence of liver injury in COVID-19 patients with severe disease are higher than in patients with mild disease.

[…] Among patients who tested positive, 45% had mild, 21% moderate, and 6.4% severe liver injury. […] In multivariable analysis, severe acute liver injury was significantly associated with elevated inflammatory markers including ferritin (OR 2.40, p&lt;0.001) and IL-6 (OR 1.45, p=0.009). […] Patients with severe liver injury had a more severe clinical course, including higher rates of ICU admission (69%), intubation (65%), renal replacement therapy (33%), and mortality (42%).

Liver transplantation during the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is challenging given the urgent need to reallocate resources to other areas of patient care. […] Thus, we report strategies and preliminary results in liver transplantation during the peak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic from a single-center in France. […] Our strategy to reorganize the transplant program included four main steps: optimization of available resources especially intensive care unit capacity, multidisciplinary risk stratification of liver transplantation candidates on the waiting list, implementation of a systematic SARS-CoV-2 screening strategy prior to transplantation and definition of optimal recipient-donor matching. […] After implementation of these four steps, we performed 10 successful liver transplantations during the peak of the pandemic with a short median intensive care unit stay (2,5 days), benchmark post-transplant morbidity and no occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection during follow-up. […] From this preliminary experience we conclude that efforts in resource planning, optimal recipient selection and organ allocation strategy are key to maintain a safe liver transplant activity.

While several studies from China have reported COVID-19-related liver injury, there are currently no data on liver dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Europe. […] The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and predictive value of abnormal liver function in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. […] Liver function was abnormal in 66.6% of patients on admission. […] In multivariate logistic regression, abnormal liver test on admission were associated with in-hospital aggravation (OR = 4.1, 95% CI 1.5-10.8; P = .004) and mortality (OR 3.3; 95% CI = 1.04-10.5; P = .04). […] This study of liver tests in a European COVID-19 population confirms a high prevalence of abnormal liver tests on admission that are predictive of severe disease course and higher in-hospital mortality.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) starting last December in China placed emphasis on liver involvement during infection.

[…] The manifestations of liver damage are usually mild (moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase activities), and generally asymptomatic. […] Few patients can still develop severe liver problems, and therapeutic options can be limited. […] Liver dysfunction may affect about one-third of the patients, with prevalence greater in men than women, and in elderly. […] During new COVID-19 infections, liver injury may be observed. […] If liver involvement appears during COVID-19 infection, however, attention is required. […] This is particularly true if patients are older or have a pre-existing history of liver diseases. […] During COVID-19 infection, the onset of liver damage impairs the prognosis, and hospital stay is longer.

[…] 14 (13.33%) patients developed liver injury. […] Notably, 4 (28.57%) patients rapidly progressed to acute-on-chronic liver failure. […] The proportion of severe COVID-19 was higher in patients with liver injury (P= 0.042). […] Complications including ACLF, acute cardiac injury and shock happened more frequently in patients with liver injury (all P&lt;0.05).

[…] This is also the same profile for those at increased risk for unrecognized underlying liver disease, especially nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Reports of liver injury in patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are emerging from China and the USA. […] A wide variety of liver function test abnormalities and few cases of severe liver failure have been reported. […] Markers of cholestatic liver injury were altered only in a minority of patients. […] Severe liver injury defined by 3×&gt; upper limit of normal was observed in 9.1% over a mean time of 10.5 days. […] Importantly, patients exhibited cytotoxicity including lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase elevations, but no signs of relevant liver function impairment. […] In summary, in a case series of hospitalized patients in Germany, cytotoxicity in the absence of severe liver dysfunction at admission and only few cases suggestive of severe liver injury during hospital were observed.

We harmonized the information from the recent existing literature on COVID-19 acute pandemic and mechanisms of damage in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as an example of chronic (non-communicable) metabolic pandemic. […] The deleterious interplay of inflammatory pathways chronically active in NAFLD and acutely in COVID-19 patients, can explain liver damage in a subgroup of patients, and might condition a worse outcome in metabolically-compromised NAFLD patients. […] In a subgroup of NAFLD patients, the underlying liver fibrosis might represent an additional and independent risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness, irrespective of metabolic comorbidities. […] Initial evidences suggest that increased liver fibrosis in NAFLD might affect COVID-19 outcome. […] In addition, long-term monitoring of post-COVID-19 NAFLD patients is advisable, to document further deterioration of liver damage.

Although it has been reported that some COVID-19 patients showed elevated liver biochemistries, there are few studies regarding clinical features and prognosis of these patients. […] Of those, 142 (29.5%) patients showed abnormal liver biochemistries on admission, and patients with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) accounted for 67.6%, 69.0%, and 16.2%, respectively. […] Those with abnormal liver biochemistries showed higher percentages of severe cases and comorbidities and were more likely to have dyspnea, chest distress or pain, and increased hemoglobin (Hb) on admission. […] The multivariable regression analysis showed that chest distress or pain (odds ratio [OR], 1.765; P = 0.018), dyspnea (OR, 2.495; P = 0.001), elevated C-reactive protein [CRP] level (OR, 1.007; P = 0.008), elevated white blood count (WBC) (OR, 1.139; P = 0.013), and elevated Hb concentration (OR, 1.024; P = 0.001) were independent factors associated with elevated liver biochemistries in COVID-19 patients. […] Conclusion: Elevated liver biochemistries were common in COVID-19 patients. […] Patients with hypoxia or severe inflammation are more likely to experience increased liver biochemistries on admission.

[…] The association between liver test abnormalities (baseline and peak values) and ICU admission or death was also explored. […] Liver test abnormalities were found in 161 (31.3%) patients. […] Baseline liver test abnormalities were associated with increased risk of ICU admission (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.24-3.89], P = 0.007) but not with mortality (OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.49-1.41], P = 0.51). […] Alterations of liver test worsened within 15 days of hospitalisation; however, in patients with the longest median follow-up, the prevalence of liver test alterations decreased over time, returning to around baseline levels. […] In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients without pre-existing severe chronic liver disease, baseline liver test abnormalities are associated with the risk of ICU admission and tend to normalise over time.

Background: Liver injury commonly occurs in patients with COVID-19. […] There is limited data describing the course of liver injury occurrence in patients with different disease severity, and the causes and risk factors are unknown. […] We aim to investigate the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19. […] From January 19, 2020 to February 20, 2020, patients confirmed with COVID-19 (≥18 years) and without liver injury were enrolled and divided into non-critically ill and critically ill groups. […] The incidence and characteristics of liver injury were compared between the two groups. […] Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, and treatment outcomes between patients with or without liver injury were compared within each group. […] The multivariable logistic regression model was used to explore the risk factors for liver injury. […] A total of 76 patients developed liver injury (mild, 40.5%; moderate, 15.3%; severe, 2.3%) with a median occurrence time of 10.0 days. […] 61.1%) of liver function than non-critically ill patients. […] Multivariable regression showed that the number of concomitant medications (odds ratio [OR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.21) and the combination treatment of lopinavir/ritonavir and arbidol (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.44-9.52) were risk factors for liver injury in non-critically ill patients. […] The metabolism of arbidol can be significantly inhibited by lopinavir/ritonavir in vitro (p &lt; 0.005), which may be the underlying cause of drug-related liver injury. […] Liver injury was related to increased length of hospital stay (mean difference [MD]: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3-5.2) and viral shedding duration (MD: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.0-4.9). […] Conclusions: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 suffered earlier occurrence, greater injury severity, and slower recovery from liver injury than non-critically ill patients. […] Drug factors were related to liver injury in non-critically ill patients. […] Liver injury was related to prolonged hospital stay and viral shedding duration in patients with COVID-19.

Severe liver damage is associated with worse outcome in COVID-19. […] Our aim was to explore the degree of liver damage, liver stiffness (LS) and severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. […] We performed laboratory testing, liver and spleen sonography and elastography to measure organ stiffness. 12 patients (38%) showed elevated aminotransferases and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels. […] Even mild liver damage raised LS significantly in COVID-19 as it was in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. […] Transient elastography is a useful and non-invasive tool to assess onset and severity of acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 patients.

However, recent data have highlighted the impact of the Sars-CoV-2 related disease namely COVID-19 on the liver. […] Hepatic abnormalities significantly increase during COVID-19 and a more severe infection occurs in patients with pre-existing liver diseases, among which the most frequent is metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). […] It has been described that MAFLD patients had a higher risk of progression to severe COVID-19, higher abnormal liver tests and longer viral shedding time. […] Due to the overgrowing prevalence of MAFLD, it could be speculated that a large proportion of the population might be at risk of severe COVID-19 and the identification of these patients possibly by using liver enzymes as risk predictors may be crucial for an early diagnosis and for the management of the infection.

The impact of COVID-19 on liver function is not well described. […] COVID-19 is frequently associated with mild liver function abnormality, particularly in individuals with severe/critical COVID-19 who were older. […] Liver function should be monitored carefully during infection, with judicious use of hepatotoxic agents where possible and avoidance of prolonged hypotension to minimize liver injury in older patients. […] We analyzed the incidence of liver function test (LFT) abnormality in these patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection.

Abnormal liver enzymes are seen in 20% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. […] The etiology of elevated liver enzymes is thought to be multifactorial including medications and underlying liver disease. […] The true prevalence and clinical significance of underlying chronic liver diseases (CLD) in COVID-19 remains poorly defined. […] To date, the clinical importance of chronic liver diseases among COVID-19 infection has remained undefined. […] In this novel systematic review and meta-analysis, the presence of underlying chronic liver disease was significantly associated with more severe COVID-19 infections and mortality.

Liver injury has been reported as a non-pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 but characterization of liver test abnormalities and their association with clinical outcomes is incomplete. […] Clinical characteristics, liver tests (AST, ALT, ALP, TBIL, albumin) at three time points (pre-infection baseline, admission, peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death) were analyzed. […] Abnormal liver tests were commonly observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, both at admission (AST 66.9%, ALT 41.6%, ALP 13.5%, TBIL 4.3%) and peak hospitalization (AST 83.4%, ALT 61.6%, ALP 22.7%, TBIL 16.1%). […] Most patients with abnormal liver tests at admission had minimal elevations 1-2x ULN (AST 63.7%, ALT 63.5%, ALP 80.0%, TBIL 75.7%). […] A significant proportion of these patients had abnormal liver tests pre-hospitalization (AST 25.9%, ALT 38.0%, ALP 56.8%, TBIL 44.4%). […] Multivariate analysis revealed an association between abnormal liver tests and severe COVID-19, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death; associations with age, male gender, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were also observed. […] Medications used in COVID-19 treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were associated with peak hospitalization liver transaminase elevations &gt;5x ULN. […] Conclusion: Abnormal liver tests occur in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.

The impact of the virus on the liver is not well known, but in patients with chronic liver disease, mostly in advanced stages, it can critically compromise survival and trigger decompensation. […] Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future.

Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, radiation oncology departments have adopted various strategies to deliver radiation therapy safely and efficiently while minimizing the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 transmission among patients and health care providers. […] One practical strategy is to deliver stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in a single fraction, which has been well established for treating bone metastases, although it has been infrequently used for other extracranial sites. […] Prospective and retrospective studies supporting a single-fraction regimen are limited, although outcomes are promising for renal cell carcinoma, liver metastases, and adrenal metastases.

Abnormal liver function has been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. […] Aim of our study was to report on the prevalence of liver injury in our cohort, to evaluate the association of mild vs severe liver injury with mortality in COVID-19 patients and to scrutinize the temporal pattern of viral detection and liver injury. […] The patients were divided into three groups according to their liver status during treatment. […] The first group included patients without elevated alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin, the third patients meeting the biochemical criteria of acute liver failure (ALF) and the second all other patients. […] Liver injury was detected in 75 (50.7%) and 93 (63%) patients by admission and during treatment respectively. […] Mortality was associated with the presence of ALF (OR=9.423, 95%CI 2.410-36.858) in contrast to milder liver injury (OR 1.101, 95%CI 0.435-2.791). […] In 30% of patients with mild liver injury and in 50% of ALF patients, peak liver injury was observed at a time point, when the virus was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract. […] Mild liver injury was not associated with worse outcome in our cohort and the pattern of liver injury did not fit well to the theory of SARS-CoV-2 directly causing liver impairment. […] Instead, severe liver injury in our cohort was associated multiple-organ failure and acute vascular events.

Background: Abnormal liver chemistries are common findings in patients with COVID-19. […] It is unclear whether abnormal liver chemistries can predict the severity of COVID-19. […] Therefore, we compared the serum liver chemistries such as hepatic transaminases, total bilirubin, albumin, and prothrombin time to evaluate whether they can predict severity and mortality in COVID-19. […] Methods: An electronic search was performed on PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for studies comparing liver chemistries in severe and mild COVID-19. […] The literature search was performed using keywords “COVID-19,” “Liver,” Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)," and “Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT),” “AST,” and “ALT,” in various combinations of “AND/OR” from December 1, 2019, till May 8, 2020. […] The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each component of liver chemistries. […] Seventeen studies compared liver chemistries for severe vs. mild COVID-19, whereas five studies compared liver chemistries in survival vs. non-survival groups. […] Conclusion: Our meta-analysis shows that deranged liver chemistries may indicate severe COVID-19 and could also predict mortality. […] Larger studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between derangement in liver chemistries and mortality in COVID-19.

Lung injury is the main outcome of COVID-19 infection; however, damage can occur in other organs including the liver. […] Currently, limited data are available that link underlying liver injury with the severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] This review summarizes the available data on liver test abnormalities in COVID-19 patients; critically evaluates the possible causes of liver injury and provides recommendations for clinicians. […] In laboratory tests, serum levels of liver test markers notably transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin were significantly higher in severe patients with COVID-19 infection. […] The use of certain drugs especially lopinavir and ritonavir showed an association with the progression of liver damage in severe cases. […] Available data suggest that liver injury in COVID-19 patients may result from direct effect by the virus, immune-mediated inflammation or drug-induced toxicity. […] Some studies demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with pre-existing liver disease are at higher risk for hospitalizations and mortality. […] Therefore, the impact of pre-existing liver disease on treatment and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 should be determined. […] Large-scale clinical studies are needed to identify the causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection.

During the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, EASL and ESCMID published a position paper to provide guidance for physicians involved in the care of patients with chronic liver disease. […] In addition, many studies have been published focusing on how COVID-19 may affect the liver and how pre-existing liver diseases might influence the clinical course of COVID-19. […] While many aspects remain poorly understood, it has become increasingly evident that pre-existing liver diseases and liver injury during the disease course must be kept in mind when caring for patients with COVID-19. […] This review should serve as an update on the previous position paper, summarising the evidence for liver disease involvement during COVID-19 and providing recommendations on how to return to routine care wherever possible.

Over the last decade, a rapid rise in deaths due to liver disease has been observed especially amongst young people. […] Nowadays liver disease accounts for approximately 2 million deaths per year worldwide: 1 million due to complications of cirrhosis and 1 million due to viral hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. […] Besides primary liver malignancies, almost all solid tumours are capable to spread metastases to the liver, in particular, gastrointestinal cancers, breast and genitourinary cancers, lung cancer, melanomas and sarcomas. […] A big portion of liver malignancies undergo palliative care. […] To this end, the paradigm of the palliative care in the liver cancer management is evolving from “just end of the life” care to careful evaluation of all aspects relevant for the survivorship. […] In the presented study, an evidence-based approach has been taken to target molecular pathways and subcellular components for modelling most optimal conditions with the longest survival rates for patients diagnosed with advanced liver malignancies who underwent palliative treatments. […] In conclusion, multi-faceted cancer control within the palliative care of liver malignancies is crucial for improved disease outcomes including individualised patient profiling, predictive models and implementation of corresponding cost-effective risks mitigating measures detailed in the paper.

Background and Aims The prevalence and extent of liver damage in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients remain poorly understood, primarily due to small-sized epidemiological studies with varying definitions of “liver injury”. […] We conducted a meta-analysis to derive generalizable, well-powered estimates of liver injury prevalence in COVID-19 patients. […] We also aimed to assess whether liver injury prevalence is significantly greater than the baseline prevalence of chronic liver disease (CLD). […] Our secondary aim was to study whether the degree of liver injury was associated with the severity of COVID-19. […] Materials and Methods Electronic databases (PubMed and Scopus) were systematically searched in June 2020 for studies reporting the prevalence of baseline CLD and current liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. […] Liver injury was defined as an elevation in transaminases &gt;3 times above the upper limit of normal. […] For the secondary analysis, all studies reporting mean liver enzyme levels in severe versus non-severe COVID-19 patients were included. […] Among a cohort of 8,817 patients, the prevalence of current liver injury was 15.7% (9.5%-23.0%), and this was significantly higher than the proportion of patients with a history of CLD (4.9% [2.2%-8.6%]; p &lt; 0.001). […] Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 have a higher than expected prevalence of liver injury, and the extent of the injury is associated with the severity of the disease.

Despite concerns that patients with liver transplants might be at increased risk of adverse outcomes from COVID-19 because of coexisting comorbidities and use of immunosuppressants, the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection on this patient group remains unclear. […] In this multicentre cohort study, we collected data on patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were older than 18 years, who had previously received a liver transplant, and for whom data had been submitted by clinicians to one of two international registries (COVID-Hep and SECURE-Cirrhosis) at the end of the patient’s disease course. […] For comparison, data from a contemporaneous cohort of consecutive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who had not received a liver transplant were collected from the electronic patient records of the Oxford University Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust. […] A propensity score-matched analysis was done to test for an association between liver transplant and death. […] Between March 25 and June 26, 2020, data were collected for 151 adult liver transplant recipients from 18 countries (median age 60 years [IQR 47-66], 102 [68%] men, 49 [32%] women) and 627 patients who had not undergone liver transplantation (median age 73 years [44-84], 329 [52%] men, 298 [48%] women). […] The groups did not differ with regard to the proportion of patients hospitalised (124 [82%] patients in the liver transplant cohort vs 474 [76%] in the comparison cohort, p=0·106), or who required intensive care (47 [31%] vs 185 [30%], p=0·837). […] However, ICU admission (43 [28%] vs 52 [8%], p&lt;0·0001) and invasive ventilation (30 [20%] vs 32 [5%], p&lt;0·0001) were more frequent in the liver transplant cohort. 28 (19%) patients in the liver transplant cohort died, compared with 167 (27%) in the comparison cohort (p=0·046). […] In the propensity score-matched analysis (adjusting for age, sex, creatinine concentration, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and ethnicity), liver transplantation did not significantly increase the risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (absolute risk difference 1·4% [95% CI -7·7 to 10·4]). […] Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that age (odds ratio 1·06 [95% CI 1·01 to 1·11] per 1 year increase), serum creatinine concentration (1·57 [1·05 to 2·36] per 1 mg/dL increase), and non-liver cancer (18·30 [1·96 to 170·75]) were associated with death among liver transplant recipients. […] Liver transplantation was not independently associated with death, whereas increased age and presence of comorbidities were. […] Factors other than transplantation should be preferentially considered in relation to physical distancing and provision of medical care for patients with liver transplants during the COVID-19 pandemic.

[…] We explored a link between systemic IL-6, related acute phase proteins and liver injury in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. 655 patients with suspected COVID-19 were screened in the emergency department at the University Hospital of Innsbruck, Austria, between February and April 2020. 96 patients (∼15%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. 15 patients required intensive-care treatment (ICT). […] Liver injury correlated with systemic IL-6 (p &lt; 0.001), CRP (p &lt; 0.001), ferritin (p &lt; 0.001) and LDH (p &lt; 0.001) concentration.

Several clinical studies refer to liver injury as the most frequent clinical extrapulmonary manifestation. […] In this review, we summarize the available clinical data concerning liver injury during COVID-19. […] Although the underlying mechanism of liver impairment is somewhat unclear, transaminases and bilirubin levels are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients. […] Moreover, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with a worse clinical course of COVID-19. […] However, several other cofactors, such as drug-induced liver injury, hyper-inflammatory response to infection, hypoxic hepatitis or preexisting underlying liver disease, cannot be excluded.

[…] Cross-sectional studies and case-control studies involving adult patients with confirmed COVID-19 and having data on liver enzymes were included. […] Many of the COVID-19 patients in the various studies had a varying degree of deranged liver enzymes. […] Severe liver injury causing significant liver damage, liver failure, or death is uncommon.

[…] Several factors, including direct cytopathic effect of the virus, immune-mediated collateral damage, or an exacerbation of preexisting liver disease may contribute to liver pathology in COVID-19. […] Due to its immunological functions, the liver is an organ likely to participate in the viral response against SARS-CoV-2 and this may predispose it to injury.

Background: Abnormal liver function is a common indication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. […] Two proposed mechanisms are liver injury mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the involvement of the systemic immune response. […] We investigated the role played by these to determine the cause of liver abnormality in the early stages of COVID-19. […] We compared clinical characteristics, viremia status, and cytokine profile on admission between patients with and without liver disorder. […] Lymphopenia was more common in the liver disorder group. […] Conclusions: Due to the infrequency of viremia, ACE2-mediated viral hepatitis does not seem to account for the commonly observed liver disorders in COVID-19 patients. […] By contrast, a dysregulated immune response may be a crucial pathogenic factor for liver disorder in the early stages of COVID-19.

To describe the characteristics of liver damage in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Sichuan area and the effect of antiviral drugs on liver function. […] The clinical data of severe COVID-19 patients admitted to Chengdu Public Health Clinical Medical Center from January 21 to February 24, 2020 were retrospectively collected, including demographic data, clinical manifestations and liver function changes within 1 week after admission to intensive care unit (ICU). […] The changes of liver function during the course of disease in severe COVID-19 patients were analyzed and summarized, and group analysis was performed. […] It was shown that the incidence of liver dysfunction in patients taking kaletra was significantly higher than those who did not take kaletra (7-day abnormal rate of ALT was 54% vs. 33%, the abnormal rate of AST was 38% vs. 33%, the abnormal rate of TBil was 8% vs. 0%), but there were no statistical differences (all P &gt; 0.05). […] It was shown that patients taking low-dose kaletra had a smaller effect on liver function within 1 week after ICU admission than those receiving normal dosage, and ALB, TBil in the reduced dose group were significantly lower than those in the normal dose group on the 2nd day after ICU admission [ALB (g/L): 33.3±2.0 vs. […] Severe COVID-19 patients in Sichuan area suffered obvious liver damage in the early course of the disease and have a slower recovery. […] It is important to pay attention to avoid using drugs that can aggravate liver damage while treating the disease.

We describe the successful pediatric liver transplant for unresectable hepatoblastoma in a 4-year-old male with COVID-19 prior to transplant. […] The patient was actively listed for liver transplant after completing four blocks of a SIOPEL-4 based regimen due to his PRETEXT IV disease which remained unresectable. […] Following three additional negative NP swabs and resolution of symptoms for four weeks, he underwent a whole-organ pediatric liver transplant. […] We describe one of the earliest, if not the first case of liver transplant following recent recovery from COVID-19 in a pediatric patient with a lethal malignant liver tumor. […] This case highlights that pediatric liver transplantation can be safely performed upon clearance of COVID-19.

[…] Temporal variations in liver parameters during disease course as well as different patterns of derangement are depicted. […] More intensive surveillance and individualized therapeutic approaches should be tailored for immunocompromised patients with advanced liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant patients.

[…] Two patients had underlying liver diseases, and two were diagnosed as having COVID-19 without any symptoms. […] Elevated ALT and GGT levels were found in 12 and 12 patients, respectively, and liver injury was observed in 15 patients (68.2%). […] Compared with the patients without liver injury, those with liver injury had a significantly higher fever during the clinical course (median, 37.5°C vs. […] A significant correlation was found between the highest serum liver values and the highest body temperature in each patient. […] Liver injury was not associated with the severity or mortality of COVID-19.

[…] Among 657 patients, 303 (46.1%) patients had liver injury with higher rate in severe/critically ill patients [148/257 (57.6%)] than those in moderate cases [155/400 (38.8%)]. […] The incidence of liver injury was much higher in male [192/303 (63.4%)] than female [111/303 (36.6%)], and in severe/critical patients [148/303 (48.8%)] with percutaneous oxygen saturation ≤ 93% [89/279 (31.9%)] or peak body temperature ≥ 38.5 °C [185/301 (61.5%)] on admission. […] Liver injury-related inflammations included increased white blood cells, neutrophils and decreased lymphocytes. […] More patients with liver injury than without had increased serum IL-2R, TNFα, ferritin, hsCRP, PCT, ESR, γ-GT, and LDH. […] Multivariate regression analysis revealed that increasing odds of liver injury were related to male, higher serum hsCRP (≥ 10 mg/L), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (≥ 5). […] Liver injury is a common complication in COVID-19 patients. […] The potential risk factors of liver injury include male, hsCRP and NLR score. […] A close monitor of liver function should be warned in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe/critical individuals.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) and cirrhosis are associated with immune dysregulation leading to concerns that these patients may be at risk of adverse outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] However, the impact of COVID-19 among patients with pre-existing liver disease remains ill-defined. […] After adjusting for baseline characteristics, factors associated with death in the total CLD cohort were age (OR 1.02; 1.01-1.04), CTP-A (OR 1.90; 1.03-3.52), CTP-B (OR 4.14; 2.4-7.65), CTP-C cirrhosis (OR 9.32; 4.80-18.08) and alcohol related liver disease (ALD) (OR 1.79; 1.03-3.13). […] Acute hepatic decompensation occurred in 46% of patients with cirrhosis, of which 21% had no respiratory symptoms. 50% of those with hepatic decompensation had acute-on-chronic liver failure.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus causing coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), with an estimated 22 million people infected worldwide so far although involving primarily the respiratory tract, has a remarkable tropism for the liver and the biliary tract. […] Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and no antecedent liver disease may display evidence of cytolytic liver damage, proportional to the severity of COVID-19 but rarely of clinical significance. […] The clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, a cohort whose global size is difficult to estimate, has been assessed appropriately only recently and data are still evolving. […] Patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 and worse liver-related outcomes as compared to those with non-cirrhotic liver disease. […] When a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 becomes available, patients with fibrotic liver disease and those with OLT should be considered as prime targets for prophylaxis of COVID-19, as all other highly susceptible subjects.

Although liver failure does not seem to occur in the absence of pre-existing liver disease, hepatic involvement in COVID-19 may correlate with overall disease severity and serve as a prognostic factor for the development of ARDS. […] The spectrum of liver injury in COVID-19 may range from direct infection by SARS-CoV-2, indirect involvement by systemic inflammation, hypoxic changes, iatrogenic causes such as drugs and ventilation to exacerbation of underlying liver disease. […] This concise review discusses the potential pathophysiological mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2 hepatic tropism as well as acute and possibly long-term liver injury in COVID-19.

[…] An ultrasound examination and a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a giant cavernous liver hemangioma. […] Surgery was intially taken into account (however, twice delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic) but later refused because it would have left the patient with dangerously few liver parenchyma. […] CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ADPKD associated with cavernous liver hemangioma.

SARS-CoV-2 shares nearly 80% of its’ genomic sequence with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both viruses known to cause respiratory symptoms and liver impairment. […] The emergence of pediatric cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIM-TS) has raised concerns over the issue of hepatic damage and liver enzyme elevation in the critically ill pediatric population with COVID-19. […] A limited number of liver histopathological studies are available that show focal hepatic periportal necrosis. […] This liver damage was associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), and pro-calcitonin. […] Proposed pathophysiological mechanisms include an uncontrolled exacerbated inflammatory response, drug-induced liver injury, direct viral infection and damage to cholangiocytes, hypoxic-ischemic lesions, and micro-thrombosis in the liver. […] Based on the physiopathological characteristics described, our group proposes a clinical protocol for the surveillance, evaluation, management, and follow-up of critically ill pediatric COVID-19 patients with liver damage.

Aim of the current guideline is to delineate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the liver.

[…] Despite the dominance of respiratory disease, acute on chronic liver disease/acute hepatic decompensation have been reported in patients with COVID-19 and preexisting liver disease, in particular cirrhosis. […] Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has a higher risk of respiratory disease progression than those without MAFLD. […] Alcohol-associated liver disease may be severely affected by COVID-19-such patients frequently have comorbidities including metabolic syndrome and smoking-induced chronic lung disease. […] Liver transplantation should be restricted to patients with high MELD scores, acute liver failure and hepatocellular cancer within Milan criteria.

Liver injury is commonly seen in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] However, the mechanism behind liver injury, particularly in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, remains unclear and the clinical course is poorly described. […] We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive hospitalized severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without liver injury who underwent immunologic testing (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1ß). […] Liver injury was defined as peak aminotransferases ≥3x ULN (40 U/L) or ≥120 U/L. […] Patients with liver injury were compared to those who had normal aminotransferases throughout the hospital course. […] The liver injury group had a longer length of stay and more severe COVID-19 despite having less diabetes and chronic kidney disease. […] An exaggerated hyper inflammatory response (cytokine storm) characterized by significantly elevated CRP, LDH, ferritin, and IL-6 levels and increasing severity of COVID-19 appears to be associated with the occurrence of liver injury in patients with severe/ critical COVID-19.

We assessed the impact of baseline liver function (aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], bilirubin) on COVID-19-related outcomes, including mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and non-fatal severe complications. after a systematic review of the relevant studies the odds ratio (OR), mean difference, sensitivity, specificity, and both positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated for the prediction of relevant COVID-19 outcomes by performing a meta-analysis using fixed and random effects models. […] The mean difference between mild and severe COVID-19 was 10.7 U/l (95 % CI, 5.8-15.6) for AST, 8 U/l (95 % CI, 1.0-15) for ALT, and 0.3 mg/dl (95 % CI, 0.16-0.45) for bilirubin. patients showing liver injury had a significantly higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 as compared to those with normal liver function tests at admission.

BACKGROUND Emerging studies noted that liver injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients may be induced by virus-mediated inflammation, which was confirmed by liver pathology. […] The aim of this study was to observe clinical characteristics and explore risk factors in COVID-19 patients with liver injury. […] The risk factors for liver injury were C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CD8+T cell count, and severity of disease, and CRP (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.045-1.222, p=0.002) was the independent risk factor. […] CONCLUSIONS Liver injury in COVID-19 patients was mild and associated with inflammatory markers, especially CRP, which suggests that liver injury may be induced by virus-mediated inflammation in COVID-19 patients.

Liver injury has been reported as a common complication in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] Recently, more and more studies reported that the degree of liver damages was associated with the severity of COVID-19. […] Although the exact mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 patients is unknown, recent studies have made some explorations and investigations. […] In this review, we summarized the potential mechanisms of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients gleaned from recently published research reports, which suggested that the progression of pre-existing liver diseases, direct damage of liver by SARS-CoV-2, systemic inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-viral drug toxicity, and hypoxia-reperfusion may be associated with liver injury in patients with COVID-19. […] Hypoxic liver injury due to ischemia and shock, cholestasis-related liver injury due to altered bile metabolism, and hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation might occur in severe COVID-19 patients with sepsis. […] To understand the pathogenesis of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, further research is needed to focus on liver-related comorbidities, the evidence of viral replication in hepatocytes and bile duct cells, histological features of liver injury, and the influence of hepatotoxic antiviral drugs. […] We also suggested that special attention should be paid to monitoring inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia for the prevention and treatment of liver injury in severe COVID-19 patients.

This report describes a case of cholestatic liver injury induced by favipiravir. […] After the initiation of antibiotics, transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated, suggesting a transient cholestasic liver dysfunction. […] The liver dysfunction in this case may have been triggered by antibacterial treatment, and high dose of favipiravir may have promoted the deterioration of liver function. […] Monitoring of liver function is vital and close attention should be paid when using favipiravir at high doses or in patients with impaired liver function.

In addition, we assessed whether there were any associations between an increase in oxygen requirement and known risk factors for critical illness in COVID-19, including elevation of liver enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytopenia, high D-dimer levels and the chest computed tomography (CT) score. […] Comorbid cardiovascular disease, lymphocytopenia, elevated CRP, liver enzyme and D-dimer levels, and higher chest CT score were significantly associated with an increase in oxygen requirement CONCLUSIONS: The expanded CURB-65 score can be a better predictor of an increase in oxygen requirement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Liver dysfunction manifesting as elevated aminotransferase levels has been a common feature of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. […] The mechanism of liver injury in COVID-19 infection is unclear. […] However, it has been hypothesized to be a result of direct cytopathic effects of the virus, immune dysfunction and cytokine storm-related multiorgan damage, hypoxia-reperfusion injury and idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury due to medications used in the management of COVID-19. […] The favored hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of liver injury in the setting of COVID-19 is cytokine storm, an aberrant and unabated inflammatory response leading to hyperproduction of cytokines. […] In the current review, we have summarized the potential pathophysiologic mechanisms of cytokine-induced liver injury based on the reported literature.

[…] The potential therapeutic mechanism of matrine on COVID-19 combined with liver injury is closely related to regulate antiviral process, improve immune system and regulate the level of inflammatory factors. […] Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that matrine could significantly reduce the expression of AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6 and ATM in mice with liver injury or lung injury (P &lt; 0.05), and increase the expression of BCL2L1 to a certain extent (P &gt; 0.05).

ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II, which promotes vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, liver and lung inflammation and fibrosis, into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang1-7), which binds to Mas receptors (MasR), resulting in arterial vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in tissues. […] The coronavirus-dependent demise of ACE2 and its product (Ang1-7) leads to cytokine activation and cytokine-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis, which in turn decreases liver reserve and may induce hepatic injury. […] In these cases, liver function deteriorates rapidly after hospital admission, suggesting that cirrhotic patients frequently die from accelerated end-stage liver disease. […] Pharmaceutical interventions which may provide novel strategies to counter liver cirrhosis decompensation due to COVID-19 include non-peptidic MasR agonist AVE0991, which replaces the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of Ang1-7, and metallopeptidase neprilysin inhibitor candoxatrilat, which reduces Ang1-7 clearance and causes portal pressure reduction with increased natriuresis in experimental cirrhosis.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with liver dysfunction, aggravation of liver burden, and liver injury. […] This study aimed to assess the effects of liver injuries on the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. […] Chronic liver disease (CLD) was confirmed by consensus diagnostic criteria. […] Laboratory test results were compared between different groups. scRNA-seq data and bulk gene expression profiles were used to identify cell types associated with liver injury. cells in these tissues. […] By generating a model, we were able to predict the risk and severity of liver injury during hospitalization. […] We demonstrate that liver injury occurring during therapy as well as pre-existing CLDs like fatty liver disease and cirrhosis in patients with COVID-19 is significantly associated with the severity of disease and mortality, but the presence of other CLD is not associated. […] We provide a risk-score model that can predict whether patients with COVID-19 will develop liver injury or proceed to higher-risk stages during subsequent hospitalizations.

Metabolic diseases are risk factors for severe Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which have a close relationship with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). […] In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the presence of liver steatosis was determined by computed tomography scan (CT). […] Liver fibrosis was assessed using the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS score), and when altered, the AST to platelet ratio index (APRI) score. […] The presence of liver fibrosis was associated with higher severity scores, higher levels of inflammatory markers, requirement of mechanical ventilation, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and higher mortality than patients without fibrosis.

Liver injury is common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), although its effect on patient outcomes has not been well studied.

[…] However, there was no significant difference found between severe and non-severe patients in the use of mechanical ventilation, mortality, hospital stay, or use and dosage of glucocorticoids between individuals with and without liver injury (all P&gt;0.05). […] The degree of disease severity (OR =7.833, 95% CI, 1.834-31.212, P=0.005) and presence of any coexisting illness (OR =4.736, 95% CI, 1.305-17.186, P=0.018) were predictable risk factors for primary composite end-point events, whereas liver injury had no significance in this aspect (OR =0.549, 95% CI, 0.477-5.156, P=0.459).

Liver injury has been observed in a significant proportion of patients, especially in those with a severe or critical illness. […] COVID-19 might provoke a deterioration of liver function in patients with already diagnosed chronic liver diseases and without pre-existing liver disorders. […] The deterioration of liver function worsens the prognosis, increases the risk of a severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and prolongs the hospital stay. […] In general, patients who develop liver dysfunction in COVID-19 are mainly males, elderly people, and those with higher body mass index. […] The underlying mechanisms for hepatic failure in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are still unclear, nevertheless liver damage appears to be directly connected with virus-induced cytopathic effects. […] A liver injury observed during hospitalization might be simultaneously caused by the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs, mainly antiviral agents. […] This minireview focuses on a possible relationship between COVID-19 and the liver, potential molecular mechanisms of liver damage, the characteristics of liver injury and suggested factors predisposing to hepatic manifestations in COVID-19 patients.
