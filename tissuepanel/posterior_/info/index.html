Forty-four of 51 (86%) patients had bilateral lung involvement, while 41 of 51 (80%) involved the posterior part of the lungs and 44 of 51 (86%) were peripheral.

<b>OBJECTIVE.</b> Available information on CT features of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is scattered in different publications, and a cohesive literature review has yet to be compiled. <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS.</b> This article includes a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), Google Scholar, and the World Health Organization database. <b>RESULTS.</b> Known features of COVID-19 on initial CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacification (GGO) with a peripheral or posterior distribution, mainly in the lower lobes and less frequently within the right middle lobe.

We aimed to ascertain the serial respiratory viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, and serum antibody responses.

[…] The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5·2 log<sub>10</sub> copies per mL (IQR 4·1-7·0). […] Posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples are a non-invasive specimen more acceptable to patients and health-care workers.

[…] In conclusion, posterior oropharyngeal saliva and NPS were found to have similar detection rates in the point-of-care test for SARS-CoV-2 detection. […] Due to the easy collection of posterior oropharyngeal saliva, the use of saliva as an alternative specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 detection is recommended.
