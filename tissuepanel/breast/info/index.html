Breast dieases are clinical common diseases. […] In the central epidemic area of COVID-19, Hubei province, especially Wuhan, the clinical specialists of breast diseases should consider all of the following factors comprehensively: the prevention of COVID-19, the diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases and the accessibility of medical resources. […] Besides, we should select the appropriate therapy and optimize treatment process so as to prevent the propagation and cross infection of COVID-19 as well as manage the breast diseases without delay. […] Therefore, we carried out some management proposals of the patients with breast diseases in the central epidemic area during the epidemic of COVID-19 on the basis of conventional treatment guidelines and clinical experiences.

In order to prevent cluster outbreaks, the government strengthened the management and control of personnel mobility, which had a great impact on the examination and treatment of breast cancer patients. […] This paper discusses how to realize scientific health management of breast cancer patients outside the hospital based on the existing epidemic situation, characteristics of breast cancer patients and public health safety factors. […] The breast cancer patients should synthetically consider the epidemic prevention situation of inhabitance, the disease stage and previous therapeutic schedule to decide the next therapeutic schedule.

Besides the possible consequences of COVID-19 infection on a pregnant woman and the fetus, a major concern is related to the potential effect on neonatal outcome, the appropriate management of the mother-newborn dyad and finally the compatibility of maternal COVID-19 infection with breastfeeding. […] The Italian Society on Neonatology (SIN) after reviewing the limited scientific knowledge on the compatibility of breastfeeding in the COVID-19 mother and the available statements from Health Care Organizations, has issued the following indications that have been endorsed by the Union of European Neonatal &amp; Perinatal Societies (UENPS). […] If a mother previously identified as COVID-19 positive or under investigation for COVID-19 is asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic at delivery, rooming-in is feasible and direct breastfeeding is advisable, under strict measures of infection control. […] On the contrary, when a mother with COVID-19 is too sick to care for the newborn, the neonate will be managed separately and fed fresh expressed breast milk, with no need to pasteurize it, as human milk is not believed to be a vehicle of COVID-19.

Breast radiotherapy accounts for a significant proportion of patient volume in contemporary radiation oncology practice. […] Here, we present evidence-based guidelines for omitting or abbreviating breast cancer radiotherapy, where appropriate, in an effort to mitigate risk to patients and optimize resource utilization. […] Multidisciplinary breast cancer experts at a high-volume comprehensive cancer center convened contingency planning meetings over the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to review the relevant literature and establish recommendations for the application of hypofractionated and abbreviated breast radiation regimens. […] Substantial evidence exists to support omitting radiation among certain favorable risk subgroups of breast cancer patients and for abbreviating or accelerating regimens among others. […] For those who require either whole-breast or post-mastectomy radiation, with or without coverage of the regional lymph nodes, a growing body of literature supports various hypofractionated approaches that appear safe and effective. […] In the setting of a public health emergency with the potential to strain critical healthcare resources and place patients at infection risk, the parsimonious application of breast radiotherapy may alleviate a significant clinical burden without compromising long term oncologic outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to highlight the importance of timely brachytherapy treatment for patients with gynecologic, breast, and prostate malignancies, and provide a framework for brachytherapy clinical practice and management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. […] We review amassing evidence to help guide the management and timing of brachytherapy for gynecologic, breast, and prostate cancers. […] Delay of prostate or breast cancer treatment may also impact oncologic outcomes. […] Every effort should be made to ensure timely brachytherapy delivery for patients with gynecologic malignancies, and endocrine therapy may help temporize treatment delays for breast and prostate cancer patients.

The epidemiological emergency caused by CoV-2 (COVID-19) has changed priorities in breast cancer management. […] In this scenario, neoadjuvant endocrine treatment could be an appropriate alternative treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer (luminal-like tumours) in order to minimise hospital admissions and to delay elective surgeries. […] Accordingly, we present a simple protocol that can be applied to most cases of luminal-like breast cancer and is appropriate for the majority of secondary or tertiary medical centres, or even primary care.

In this article, we attempt to estimate the individual risk-benefit balance to define personalized strategies for optimal breast cancer management, avoiding as much as possible a general untailored approach. […] We discuss and report the strategies our Breast Unit adopted from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak to ensure the continuum of the best possible cancer care for our patients while mitigating the risk of infection, despite limited health care resources. […] IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Managing patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak is challenging.

The prioritisation of high value cancer interventions must be embedded in the agenda for the pandemic response, ensuring that no inconsistency or discrepancy emerge in the health planning processes.The aim of this work is to organise health interventions for breast cancer management and research in a tiered framework (high, medium, low value), formulating a scheme of prioritisation per clinical cogency and intrinsic value or magnitude of benefit. […] Considerations for implementation and the essential link to pre-existing health services, especially primary healthcare, are addressed, outlining a framework for the development of effective and functional services, such as telemedicine.The discussion covers the theme of health systems strategising, and why oncology care, in particular breast cancer care, should be maintained in parallel to pandemic control measures, providing a pragmatic clinical model within the broader context of public healthcare schemes.

The lack of knowledge regarding the transmission mechanisms and the potential risks for the mother and the newborn, even when the vertical transmission of the virus has not been demonstrated, has led to the abandonment of practices such as skin-to-skin and the early initiation of breastfeeding (BF), which offer great benefits for maternal and child health. […] If a temporary separation of mother and child is required, it is recommended to feed the newborn with expressed breast milk.

Methods: This is an observational prospective study that included pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR test on a nasopharyngeal swab at the moment of childbirth and who wanted to breastfeed their newborns. […] To collect the samples, the mothers wore surgical masks, washed their hands with an 85% alcohol-based gel, and washed their breast with gauze that was saturated with soap and water. […] Conclusion: In our study, breast milk was not a source of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. […] Hand expression (assuring that a mask is used and that appropriate hygienic measures are used for the hands and the breast), when direct breastfeeding is not possible, appears to be a safe way of feeding newborns of mothers with COVID-19.

The Italian College of Breast Radiologists by the Italian Society of Medical Radiology (SIRM) provides recommendations for breast care provision and procedural prioritization during COVID-19 pandemic, being aware that medical decisions must be currently taken balancing patient’s individual and community safety: (1) patients having a scheduled or to-be-scheduled appointment for in-depth diagnostic breast imaging or needle biopsy should confirm the appointment or obtain a new one; (2) patients who have suspicious symptoms of breast cancer (in particular: new onset palpable nodule; skin or nipple retraction; orange peel skin; unilateral secretion from the nipple) should request non-deferrable tests at radiology services; (3) asymptomatic women performing annual mammographic follow-up after breast cancer treatment should preferably schedule the appointment within 1 year and 3 months from the previous check, compatibly with the local organizational conditions; (4) asymptomatic women who have not responded to the invitation for screening mammography after the onset of the pandemic or have been informed of the suspension of the screening activity should schedule the check preferably within 3 months from the date of the not performed check, compatibly with local organizational conditions. […] The Italian College of Breast Radiologists by SIRM recommends precautions to protect both patients and healthcare workers (radiologists, radiographers, nurses, and reception staff) from infection or disease spread on the occasion of breast imaging procedures, particularly mammography, breast ultrasound, breast magnetic resonance imaging, and breast intervention procedures.

There is an incomplete understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and transmission potential at this time and the resultant anxiety has led to variable breastfeeding recommendations for suspected or confirmed mothers with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] Due to the potential concern for transmission of infection from maternal respiratory secretions to the newborn, temporary separation of the maternal-baby dyad, allowing for expressed breast milk to be fed to the infant, was initially recommended but later revised to include breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatrics in contrast to international societies, which recommend direct breastfeeding. […] Only two publications have reported SARS-CoV-2 in human breast milk but the role of breast milk as a vehicle of transmission of COVID-19 to the newborns still remains unclear and may indeed be providing protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infection even in infected neonates. […] Symptomatic mothers on hydroxychloroquine can safely breastfeed and no adverse effects were reported in a baby treated with remdesivir in another drug trial. […] The excretion of sarilumab in human breast milk is unknown at this time. […] Hence, given the overall safety of breast milk and both short-term and long- term nutritional, immunological, and developmental advantages of breast milk to newborn, breast milk should not be withheld from baby. […] The setting of maternal care, severity of maternal infection and availability of resources can impact the decision of breastfeeding, the role of shared decision making on breastfeeding between mother and physician needs to be emphasized. […] We strongly recommend direct breastfeeding with appropriate hygiene precautions unless the maternal or neonatal health condition warrants separation of this dyad. […] KEY POINTS: · Breastmilk does not appear to play a significant role in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.. […] · Mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 can directly breastfeed with appropriate precautions..

Mothers could practice skin-to-skin care and breastfeed in the delivery room, but had to wear a surgical mask when near their neonate and practice proper hand hygiene before skin-to-skin contact, breastfeeding, and routine care. […] Unless medically required, neonates were kept in a closed Giraffe isolette in the same room as their mothers, and were held by mothers for feeding after appropriate hand hygiene, breast cleansing, and placement of a surgical mask. […] All mothers were allowed to breastfeed; at 5-7 days of life, 64 (78%) were still breastfeeding. 79 (96%) of 82 neonates had a repeat PCR at 5-7 days of life, which was negative in all; 72 (88%) neonates were also tested at 14 days of life and none were positive.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical delays have been common for patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, often in favor of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). […] Patients with DCIS or ER+ cT1-2N0 breast cancer treated from 2010 through 2016 were identified in the National Cancer Database.

As a result from restricted economic activities and social distancing due to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we observed a 49.4% decrease in outpatient appointments at our Institution. to minimize this impact on screening and oncological follow-up of breast cancer patients, telemedicine appointments were established. […] Of the 77 patients who had telemedicine appointments, 36 (46.8%) accounted for breast cancer follow-up, 20 (26%) for breast cancer screening, 10 (13%) for benign breast disease evaluation, 7 (9%) for a second opinion, and 4 (5.2%) for general orientations. […] Routine surveillance/follow-up exams were requested for 45 (58.4%) patients and breast image exams and a request to return for a personal appointment for 30 (39%) patients. […] In conclusion, telemedicine may be a feasible alternative to reduce personal outpatient appointments for cancer follow-up and breast cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to providing life-giving nutrients and other substances to the breastfed infant, human milk can also represent a vehicle of pathogen transfer. […] As such, when an infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic occurs-particularly when it is associated with a novel pathogen-the question will naturally arise as to whether the pathogen can be transmitted through breastfeeding. […] Until high-quality data are generated to answer this question, abandonment of breastfeeding due to uncertainty can result. […] During these times of uncertainty, it is critical for investigators conducting research to assess the possible transmission of pathogens through milk, whether by transfer through the mammary gland or contamination from respiratory droplets, skin, breast pumps, and milk containers, and/or close contact between mother and infant.

Deferment of definitive surgery for some breast cancers has been proposed as a way to conserve hospital resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. […] However, it is currently unknown which, if any, breast cancers are capable of progressing during a few to several months of observation. […] The difference between clinical size at diagnosis and final pathology size was assessed in 315 stage I-III primary invasive breast cancer patients who were divided into three groups based on the time between diagnosis and definitive surgery. […] Specific growth rates were significantly greater for luminal B breast cancers than for luminal A breast cancers (p = 0.029) but not for triple-negative or HER2-positive breast cancers not selected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. […] Fewer than 20% of stage I-III breast cancers not selected for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy evidence size progression during follow-up periods ranging from 61 to 294 days. […] If resource limitations mandate prioritization schemes for breast cancer surgery, luminal B breast cancer may be the highest priority.

Here, we delineate the intricate relationship between breast cancer and COVID-19. […] Breast cancer and COVID-19 share involvement of common comorbidities, hormonal signalling pathways, gender differences, rennin-angiotensin system (RAS), angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). […] We also shed light on the possible effects of therapeutic modalities of COVID-19 on breast cancer outcomes. […] Briefly, we conclude that breast cancer patients are more susceptible for COVID-19 in comparison with their normal counterparts. […] Increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are being correlated with occurrence and severity of COVID-19, but higher expression of ACE2 and lower expression of TMPRSS2 are prognostic markers for overall and disease free survival in breast cancer. […] The ACE2 inhibitors and ibuprofen therapies for COVID-19 treatment may aggravate the clinical condition of the breast cancer patients through chemo-resistance and metastasis. […] Most of the available therapeutic modalities for COVID-19 were also found to exert positive effects on breast cancer outcomes.
