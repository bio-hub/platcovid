Since information on kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 is limited, we determined the prevalence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19. […] Further, we evaluated the association between markers of abnormal kidney function and death in patients with COVID-19. […] Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney disease had a significantly higher risk for in-hospital death. […] Thus, our findings show the prevalence of kidney disease on admission and the development of AKI during hospitalization in patients with COVID-19 is high and is associated with in-hospital mortality. […] Hence, clinicians should increase their awareness of kidney disease in patients with severe COVID-19.

Little is known about risk, presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection in kidney transplantation recipients, who may be at high-risk due to long-term immunosuppression, comorbidity and residual chronic kidney disease. […] Whilst COVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease, in severe cases it can cause kidney and multi-organ failure. […] Therefore, we report on seven cases of COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients (median age 54 (range 45-69), three females, from a cohort of 2082 managed transplant follow-up patients) over a six-week period in three south London hospitals. […] Thus, our findings suggest COVID-19 infection in kidney transplant patients may be severe, requiring intensive care admission.

To summarize measures for the prevention and control of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the department of kidney transplantation. […] We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of outpatients and inpatients in the department of kidney transplantation from January 20 to March 1, 2020, and followed up the in-home kidney transplant recipients and those waiting for kidney transplantation through the Internet platform. […] Our department had formulated detailed prevention and control measures, mainly including kidney transplant outpatient management, kidney transplantation ward management, management of kidney transplant surgery, dialysis management of patients waiting for kidney transplantation, personal protection of medical staff, and follow-up management of discharged patients after kidney transplantation. […] During the epidemic period, there were no COVID-19 cases among 68 outpatient examined kidney transplant recipients, 32 hospitalized kidney transplant recipients, 19 patients waiting for kidney transplantation in hospital, and 30 medical staff. […] There were no COVID-19 cases among 160 follow-up recipients after kidney transplantation and 60 patients waiting for kidney transplantation.

[…] The main SARS-CoV-2-related COVID-19 symptoms/diseases reported hitherto are hypertension, atherosclerosis, thrombosis (coagulopathy), diarrhea, glaucoma, anosmia, ageusia, skin lesions (dermatitis), autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system, and damages to various organs such as the lung, heart, kidney, and testicle [1, 2, 14].

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) is expressed in epithelial cells of many tissues including the kidney, and has been identified to interact with human pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. […] Although diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory failure are the main features of COVID-19 infection, two recent studies demonstrate that kidney impairment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is common, and that kidney involvement is associated with high risk of in-hospital death. […] Interestingly, studies in rats have demonstrated that high dietary sodium intake results in down-regulation of the ACE2 expression in kidney tissue. […] We hypothesize that low sodium status makes kidney involvement during the course of COVID-19 infection more likely due to upregulation of membrane bound ACE2 in the kidneys. […] We propose that sodium intake and status should be monitored carefully during severe COVID-19 infections, and that low sodium intake be corrected early in its course, despite a potential conflict regarding common dietary recommendations to restrict dietary sodium intake in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and kidney disease.

[…] Data from our study suggest that a strategy of systematic triage to outpatient or inpatient care, early management of concurrent bacterial infections and judicious adjustment of immunosuppressive drugs rather than cessation is feasible in kidney transplant recipients with Covid-19.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is thought to cause kidney injury by a variety of mechanisms. […] We evaluated biopsy samples of native and allograft kidneys from patients with COVID-19 at a single center in New York City between March and June of 2020. […] Sixteen patients had comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, malignancy, or a kidney or heart allograft. […] Among 14 patients with a native kidney biopsy, 5 were diagnosed with collapsing glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with minimal change disease, 2 were diagnosed with membranous glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with crescentic transformation of lupus nephritis, 1 was diagnosed with anti-GBM nephritis, and 4 were diagnosed with isolated acute tubular injury. […] We found no definitive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney cells. […] Our findings provide evidence against direct viral infection of the kidneys as the major pathomechanism for COVID-19-related kidney injury and implicate cytokine-mediated effects and heightened adaptive immune responses.

The novel coronavirus disease infection (COVID-19) outbreak that was declared a global pandemic in March 2020 had led to an internationally variable but concerning incidence of COVID-associated acute kidney injury (AKI), with prevalence reported as high as 46% in large cohorts of hospitalized patients. […] Further, AKI requiring kidney replacement therapies (KRT) has been associated with increased mortality. […] Proposed mechanisms of kidney injury include direct viral-induced tubular or glomerular injury, sepsis-associated AKI, and thrombotic disease. […] Kidney pathology include acute tubular injury, glomerular fibrin thrombi, pigmented tubular casts, and collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. […] “Viral-like” particles have been observed in renal samples at electron microscopy and viral RNA has been identified in both glomerular and tubular compartments of kidney specimens, but the link between viral presence and injury remain unclear. […] Though the link between AKI and poor outcomes is clear, prevalence and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with chronic kidney disease and end stage kidney disease has not yet been reported. […] In patients on immunosuppression like those with kidney transplants or glomerular disease, COVID-19 has presented a management dilemma. […] Herein, we review the existing literature on kidney disease in COVID-19 and discuss what remains to be learned.

In this review the characteristics and mechanism of kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized and contrasted. […] In particular, urine-oral transmission, prevention and management of the kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 are emphasized. […] We searched PubMed® for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords “SARS,” “MERS,” “COVID-19” or “kidney injury.” […] Similar to 2 other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 caused severe respiratory syndrome with rapid progression and kidney injury. […] Cases of COVID-19 combined with kidney impairment are associated with a higher risk of mortality than those without comorbidities. […] The pathological changes of the kidney are mainly due to local SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirectly by pro-inflammatory cytokine response. […] Ultimately this is significant for preventing potential urine-oral transmission and improving the cure rate of acute kidney injury with COVID-19. […] Emerging evidence supports that in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections the prevalence of kidney injury is high and usually leads to a poor prognosis. […] Optimal prevention and management of kidney injury will benefit patients with COVID-19.

[…] Our findings indicate that immunosuppressed kidney transplant recipients admitted to the hospital with acute COVID-19 infection can mount SARS-CoV-2-reactive adaptive immune responses. […] The findings raise the possibility that empiric reductions in immunosuppressive therapy for all kidney transplant recipients with active COVID-19 may not be required.

Kidney transplant recipients who develop symptoms consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are bringing unique challenges to health care professionals. […] Herein we present reports of 3 kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who were managed using telemedicine via synchronous video visits integrated with an electronic medical record system, from home to inpatient settings. […] While there is limited information about the duration of viral shedding for immunosuppressed patients, our findings underscore the importance of using telemedicine in the follow-up care for kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 who have recovered from symptoms but might have persistently positive nucleic acid tests. […] Our experience emphasizes the opportunities of telemedicine in the management of kidney transplant recipients with COVID-19 and in the maintenance of uninterrupted follow-up care for such immunosuppressed patients with prolonged viral shedding. […] Telemedicine may help increase access to care for kidney transplant recipients during and beyond the pandemic as it offers a prompt, safe, and convenient platform in the delivery of care for these patients. […] Yet, to advance the practice of telemedicine in the field of kidney transplantation, barriers to increasing the widespread implementation of telemedicine should be removed, and research studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of telemedicine in the care of kidney transplant recipients.

Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. […] Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. […] In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. […] This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. […] The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.

[…] We present the recommendations of the Brazilian Society of Nephrology regarding the treatment of pediatric patients with kidney diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic. […] We present recommendations on outpatient care, transportation to dialysis centers, peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and kidney transplantation in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. […] Despite initial observations of higher mortality rates in specific age groups (the elderly) and with comorbidities (obese, diabetics, and those with cardiovascular diseases), patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on RRT are particularly prone to develop COVID-19.

[…] To guarantee the security of medical staff and recipients and to reduce the transmission risk of COVID-19, we have made detailed approaches to prevent COVID-19, which mainly included 6 aspects of preventive approaches, such as kidney transplant clinic, kidney transplant ward, patients on waiting-list for kidney transplantation, kidney transplant operation, medical staff self-protection, and postoperative follow-up of kidney transplant recipients. […] There were altogether 47 inpatients which included 20 recipients who had just received kidney transplantation in the meantime, 2 577 kidney transplant recipients, 1 689 patients on waiting-list for kidney transplantation, and 794 outpatients in our hospital. […] Through strictly implementing proactive and preventive approaches, we avoid the occurrence of COVID-19 in carrying out kidney transplantation in the epidemic period.

[…] Presence (versus absence) of pre-existing kidney disease OUTCOME(S): In-hospital mortality (primary); respiratory failure, shock, ventricular arrhythmia/ cardiac arrest, thromboembolic event, major bleed, and acute liver injury (secondary) ANALYTICAL APPROACH: We used standardized differences to compare patient characteristics (values &gt;0.10 indicate a meaningful difference between groups) and multivariable adjusted Fine and Gray survival models to examine outcome associations. […] Dialysis patients had a shorter time from symptom onset to ICU admission compared to other groups (median [quartile 1-quartile 3] days: 4 [2-9] for dialysis patients; 7 [3-10] for CKD patients; 7 [4-10] for patients without pre-existing kidney disease). […] More dialysis patients (25%) reported altered mental status than those with CKD (20%, standardized difference = 0.12) and no kidney disease (12%, standardized difference = 0.36). […] Half of dialysis and CKD patients died within 28-days of ICU admission versus 35% of patients without pre-existing kidney disease. […] Compared to patients without pre-existing kidney disease, dialysis patients had a higher risk of 28-day in-hospital death (adjusted HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09, 1.81), while patients with CKD had an intermediate risk (adjusted HR 1.25; 95% CI 1.08, 1.44).

[…] We identified differences in COVID-19 mortality across countries, and an increased mortality risk in older patients receiving kidney replacement therapy and male patients receiving dialysis. […] In recipients of kidney transplants older than 75 years of age 44.3% (35.7%-53.9%) did not survive COVID-19.

Frequently, the kidneys are involved through direct or indirect mechanisms. […] Kidney involvement mainly manifests itself as proteinuria and acute kidney injury (AKI). […] The SARS-CoV-2-induced kidney damage is expected to be multifactorial; directly it can infect the kidney podocytes and proximal tubular cells and based on an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway it can lead to acute tubular necrosis, protein leakage in Bowman’s capsule, collapsing glomerulopathy and mitochondrial impairment.

COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased in patients with diabetes and kidney disease via unknown mechanisms. […] Since ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. […] Single cell RNA profiling of healthy living donor and kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. […] ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. […] Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public-omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. […] The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. […] Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 related kidney damage.

In addition to being a target of the virus, the kidney also seems to have a substantial influence on the outcomes of the disease. […] Data was obtained by a comprehensive and non-systematic search in the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases, using mainly the terms “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “chronic kidney disease”, “renal transplantation”, acute kidney injury" and “renal dysfunction” Discussion: The membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV- -2, and this interaction may lead to an imbalance of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS), associated with worse clinical presentations of COVID-19, including acute pulmonary injury, hyperinflammatory state and hematological alterations. […] In the framework of renal diseases, the development of acute kidney injury is associated mostly with immune alterations and direct cytopathic lesions by the virus, leading to higher mortality. […] As for chronic kidney disease, the patients at a non-terminal stage have a worse prognosis, while the hemodialysis patients appear to have mild courses of COVID-19, probably due to lower chances of being affected by the cytokine storm. […] Furthermore, the current scenario is unfavorable to kidney donation and transplantation. […] The relationship between COVID-19 and immunosuppression in kidney transplantation recipients has been greatly discussed to determine whether it increases mortality and how it interacts with immunosuppressive medications. […] The kidney and the RAS exert fundamental roles in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and more research is required to have a complete understanding of the repercussions caused by COVID-19 in renal diseases.

End stage kidney disease increase the risk of COVID-19 related death but how the kidney replacement strategy should be adapted during the pandemic is unknown. […] Alternatively, kidney transplantation could increase the severity of COVID-19 due to therapeutic immunosuppression and contribute to saturation of intensive care units. […] For these reasons, kidney transplantation was suspended in France during the first epidemic wave. […] Here, we retrospectively evaluated this strategy by comparing the overall and COVID-19 related mortality in kidney transplant recipients and candidates over the last three years. […] Cross-interrogation of two national registries for the period 1 March and 1 June 2020, identified 275 deaths among the 42812 kidney transplant recipients and 144 deaths among the 16210 candidates. […] Thus, in case of a second epidemic wave, kidney transplantation should be suspended in high viral risk areas but maintained outside those areas, both to reduce the excess of deaths of candidates and avoid wasting precious resources.

Beyond airway infection and acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury is common in SARS-CoV-2-associated infection, and acute kidney injury (AKI) is predictive to multiorgan dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infection. […] Beyond the cytokine storm and hemodynamic instability, SARS-CoV-2 might directly induce kidney injury and cause histopathologic characteristics, including acute tubular necrosis, podocytopathy and microangiopathy. […] The expression of apparatus mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17), within the renal tubular cells is highly associated with acute kidney injury mediated by SARS-CoV-2. […] In the podocytes of the glomerulus, injured podocyte expressed CD147, which mediated the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and worsen further foot process effacement, which would worsen proteinuria, and the chronic hazard induced by SARS-CoV-2-mediated kidney injury is still unknown.

We identified 21 clinical phenotypes in 5 disease categories meeting phenome-wide significance (P&lt;1.60x10-4), including: six kidney phenotypes, e.g. end stage renal disease or stage 5 CKD (OR = 11.07, p = 1.96x10-8), six cardiovascular phenotypes, e.g. congestive heart failure (OR = 3.8, p = 3.24x10-5), five respiratory phenotypes, e.g. chronic airway obstruction (OR = 2.54, p = 3.71x10-5), and three metabolic phenotypes, e.g. type 2 diabetes (OR = 1.80, p = 7.51x10-5). […] Additional analyses defining CKD based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, confirmed high risk of hospitalization associated with pre-existing stage 4 CKD (OR 2.90, 95% CI: 1.47, 5.74), stage 5 CKD/dialysis (OR 8.83, 95% CI: 2.76, 28.27), and kidney transplant (OR 14.98, 95% CI: 2.77, 80.8) but not stage 3 CKD (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.48).

Detailed information on glomerulonephritis diagnosis, kidney parameters, and baseline immunosuppression prior to infection were recorded, as well as clinical presentation, laboratory values, treatment, complications, and outcomes of COVID-19. […] Patients with glomerulonephritis had significantly higher mortality (15% vs. 5%, respectively) and acute kidney injury (39% vs. 14%) than controls, while the need for kidney replacement therapy was not statistically different between the two groups. […] Receiving immunosuppression or renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors at presentation did not increase the risk of death or acute kidney injury in the glomerulonephritis cohort. […] In the cohort with glomerulonephritis, lower serum albumin at presentation and shorter duration of glomerular disease were associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and need for kidney replacement therapy. […] Thus, due to the higher mortality and risk of acute kidney injury than in the general population without glomerulonephritis, patients with glomerulonephritis and COVID-19 should be carefully monitored, especially when they present with low serum albumin levels.

We examined how hypertension, its major metabolic co-phenotypes, and antihypertensive medications relate to ACE2 renal expression using information from up to 436 patients whose kidney transcriptomes were characterized by RNA-sequencing. […] Our data reveal increasing expression of ACE2 with age in both human lungs and the kidney. […] We demonstrate that renal abundance of ACE2 is positively associated with a biochemical index of kidney function and show a strong enrichment for genes responsible for kidney health and disease in ACE2 co-expression analysis. […] Our results indicate that neither hypertension nor antihypertensive treatment is likely to alter the expression of the key entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the human kidney. […] Our data further suggest that in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, kidney ACE2 is most likely nephro-protective but the age-related increase in its expression within lungs and kidneys may be relevant to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Presumably, numerous studies have found that SARS-CoV-2 also transpires in kidney tissue with permanent viral loads. […] However, it is elusive as to whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly damage the kidney or induce acute renal failure. […] Hence, to comprehensively understand the impact of COVID-19 on kidney damage, we conducted a retrospective series of case studies to assess kidney functions. […] Additionally, ACE2 distribution in kidney tissue was analyzed through RNAseq data in open-access databases. […] Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis showed high ACE2 expression in kidney tubule and collecting duct principal cells as well as glomerular parietal epithelial cells. […] Coronavirus may directly bind to ACE2-positive cells and damage kidney tissue in the analysis of scRNA-seq data in kidney tissue. […] Therefore, this evidence suggests that kidney tissue act as the SARS-CoV-2 infection site and the findings could provide insight into the pathophysiology of kidney damage.

[…] We identified 8 key areas of pediatric kidney transplant care that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) transplant activity, (2) outpatient clinic activity, (3) monitoring, (4) multidisciplinary care, (5) medications (immunosuppression and others), (6) patient/family education/support, (7) school and employment, and (8) management of pediatric kidney transplant patients who are COVID-19 positive.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and immunosuppression, such as in renal transplantation (RT), stand as one of the established potential risk factors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). […] Patients with CKD Stages 3-5, chronic HD and RT were compared with patients who had COVID-19 but no kidney disease. […] Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with CKDs, including Stages 3-5 CKD, HD and RT, have significantly higher mortality than patients without kidney disease.

[…] We performed a literature search of the Pubmed and Google Scholar database from 1996 to 2020 using the following keywords: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, and acute kidney injury to find the most pertinent and highest-quality of evidence.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a frequent and severe complication in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in the intensive care unit. […] The main risk factor for kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy is the necessity for invasive ventilation, whereby the onset of renal failure is often closely associated with the timing of intubation. […] AKI in COVID-19 shows a high mortality and in some patients leads to chronic kidney disease; however, full recovery of kidney function in survivors who need dialysis is not uncommon. […] With respect to prevention and treatment of renal failure associated with COVID-19, the same recommendations as for AKI from other causes are valid (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, KDIGO bundles).

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury is a condition that in many ways resembles classical acute kidney injury. […] The pathophysiology appears to be multifactorial, and accordingly, our main objective was to review possible components of this form of acute kidney injury. […] Our principal observation was that the various components of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury appear to be relatively similar to the classical forms. […] Temporality of injury is an important factor but is not specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury. […] Several insults hit the kidney at different moments in the course of disease, some occurring prior to hospital admission, whereas others take place at various stages during hospitalization. […] Treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 acute kidney injury cannot be approached in a “one-size-fits-all” manner. […] The numerous mechanisms involved do not occur simultaneously, leading to a multiple hit model that may contribute to the prevalence and severity of acute kidney injury. […] A personalized approach to each patient with acute kidney injury based on the timing and severity of disease is necessary in order to provide appropriate treatment. […] Although data from the literature regarding the previous coronavirus infections can give some insights, more studies are needed to explore the different mechanisms of acute kidney injury occurring as a result of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with severe coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is common and is a significant predictor of morbidity and mortality, especially when dialysis is required.

[…] Others have been found to have collapsing glomerulopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy and diverse underlying kidney diseases. […] A primary kidney pathology related to COVID-19 has not yet emerged. […] Thus far direct infection of the kidney, or its impact on clinical disease remains controversial. […] Within days of admission to the intensive care unit he developed oliguric acute kidney failure requiring dialysis. […] Acute kidney injury developed in the setting of hemodynamic instability, sepsis and a maculopapular rash. […] Given the broad differential diagnoses for acute kidney injury, a kidney biopsy was performed and revealed granulomatous tubulo-interstitial nephritis with some acute tubular injury. […] The kidney function and hemolysis improved over the subsequent days and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, no-longer required dialysis. […] Acute kidney injury in patients with severe COVID-19 may have multiple causes.

Current data show that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients suffer from kidney damage, in the form of proteinuria, hematuria or acute kidney injury (AKI). […] Early reports of histopathologic examination from autopsied kidney tissue show SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in renal tubular cells and podocytes, suggesting direct viral infection, as well as findings of acute tubular necrosis, while rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI and glomerulopathies may also occur. […] This review discusses the prevalence of AKI and its association with outcome, while highlighting possible mechanisms of AKI and suggesting organ protective measures to prevent the development of kidney damage.

[…] Before treatment, in both kidney transplant recipients and one hemodialysis patient antibodies were undetectable by ELISA (ratio &lt; 1.1), corresponding to low neutralizing antibody titers (≤1:40). […] After intermittent clinical improvement, one kidney transplant recipient again developed typical symptoms on Day 12 after treatment and received a second cycle of CP treatment.

Before COVID-19, chronic kidney disease was already considered a risk multiplier in patients with diabetes and hypertension, the two now being the major risk factors for COVID-19 infection and adverse outcome. […] In contrast to the urgent need for action, the nephrology field is considered to be in a state of stagnation regarding the management of chronic kidney disease patients who still experience unacceptably high morbidity and mortality. […] A promising positive example of improving heart and kidney outcomes is the emerging treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.
